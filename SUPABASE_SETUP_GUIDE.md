### Step 3: Copy the Service Role Key
1. Look for the **Project API keys** section

3. Click **Add a variable**
4. Add these variables:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ... (the service role key you copied)
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key (create a random 32+ character string)
```

### Step 5: Redeploy
After adding the environment variables, redeploy your site:
```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES

- **NEVER commit the service role key to your repository**
- The service role key bypasses Row Level Security (RLS)
- Only use it in secure server environments (like Netlify Functions)
- For frontend code, use the `anon` key instead

```bash
curl https://www.sichrplace.com/api/auth-register

{
