# üîí SECURITY VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS & IMPACT ASSESSMENT

## Current Open Vulnerabilities: 17 Total
- **HIGH (11)**: multer (4), tar-fs (7) 
- **MEDIUM (4)**: next, ipx, esbuild, http-proxy-middleware
- **LOW (2)**: tmp, on-headers

---

## CRITICAL HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES (11)

### 1. MULTER VULNERABILITIES (4 Issues - IDs: 1, 9, 10, 11)
**Package**: `multer@1.4.5-lts.1`
**Impact on Account Creation**: üö® CRITICAL
- **DoS via unhandled exceptions** from malformed requests
- **Memory leaks** from unclosed streams
- **DoS from maliciously crafted requests**

**Where it affects us**:
- Account creation with profile pictures/documents
- File uploads in landlord/tenant profiles
- Could crash registration process

**Fix Required**: Update to multer@1.4.6+ or replace with secure alternative

### 2. TAR-FS VULNERABILITIES (7 Issues - IDs: 18, 19, 22, 23, 32, 33, 34)
**Package**: `tar-fs` (indirect dependency)
**Impact on Account Creation**: üî• SEVERE
- **Path traversal attacks** via crafted tar files
- **Symlink validation bypass** 
- **Directory extraction outside specified paths**

**Where it affects us**:
- Build process vulnerabilities
- Could compromise entire server
- Affects deployment security

**Fix Required**: Update all dependencies that use tar-fs

## MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES (4)

### 3. NEXT.JS SSRF (ID: 30)
**Package**: `next` 
**Impact**: Middleware redirect handling leads to SSRF
**Our Usage**: Not directly used in account creation, but affects overall security

### 4. IPX PATH TRAVERSAL (ID: 27)  
**Package**: `ipx`
**Impact**: Path traversal via prefix matching bypass
**Our Usage**: Image processing - could affect profile picture uploads

### 5. ESBUILD DEV SERVER (ID: 13)
**Package**: `esbuild`
**Impact**: Development server vulnerability 
**Our Usage**: Build process - development environment risk

### 6. HTTP-PROXY-MIDDLEWARE (ID: 20)
**Package**: `http-proxy-middleware`
**Impact**: Double writeBody calls
**Our Usage**: Potentially used in API proxying

---

## LOW SEVERITY ISSUES (2)

### 7. TMP SYMLINK (ID: 28)
**Package**: `tmp`
**Impact**: Arbitrary file write via symlink
**Our Usage**: Temporary file operations

### 8. ON-HEADERS MANIPULATION (ID: 26)
**Package**: `on-headers`
**Impact**: HTTP response header manipulation
**Our Usage**: Express middleware stack

---

## IMPACT ON ACCOUNT CREATION SYSTEM

### üö® CRITICAL BLOCKERS:
1. **MULTER**: Could crash registration when users upload files
2. **TAR-FS**: Could compromise server during deployment

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SECONDARY IMPACTS:
1. **IPX**: Profile picture upload vulnerabilities
2. **HTTP-PROXY-MIDDLEWARE**: API request handling issues

### üìã DIAGNOSIS IN OUR WORKSPACE:
- Registration system uses file uploads (multer dependency)
- Build process uses tar-fs (indirect via npm packages)
- These vulnerabilities could cause network errors in registration

---

## SYSTEMATIC FIX PLAN

### Phase 1: CRITICAL HIGH (Fix 3 vulnerabilities)
- Fix multer vulnerabilities (4 issues)
- Update tar-fs dependencies

### Phase 2: MEDIUM & LOW (Fix remaining)
- Update next.js, ipx, esbuild
- Fix proxy and header issues

This explains why users might experience "network errors" during account creation - the multer vulnerabilities could crash the upload handling!
