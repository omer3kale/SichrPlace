# SichrPlace UI/UX Bug Fixes Implementation Plan

## Status Summary
‚úÖ Completed: Build reliability system, secret scanning, environment sanitization  
üîÑ In Progress: Systematic UI bug investigation and fixes  
‚≠ê **Current Focus**: Implementing comprehensive bug fixes based on detailed user report

## Issues Identified & Solutions

### 1. Footer Navigation Issues ‚úÖ INVESTIGATED
**Issue**: User reports "About, FAQ, Customer Service return page not found"
**Analysis**: Files actually exist:
- `frontend/about.html` ‚úÖ EXISTS
- `frontend/faq.html` ‚úÖ EXISTS  
- `frontend/customer-service.html` ‚úÖ EXISTS

**Root Cause**: Likely server routing/configuration issue rather than missing files
**Solution**: Update server configuration and test routing

### 2. Language Switcher Disappearing ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS FIXING
**Issue**: "When I click on language switcher it disappears"
**Analysis**: JavaScript in `frontend/js/language-switcher.js` handles dropdown toggles
**Root Cause**: CSS/JavaScript event handling issue
**Solution**: Fix dropdown behavior and CSS active states

### 3. Account Creation Network Error ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS FIXING  
**Issue**: "Network error. Please try again" during account creation
**Analysis**: Frontend calls `/.netlify/functions/auth-register` endpoint
**Root Cause**: Netlify function may be missing/misconfigured or environment issues
**Solution**: Verify Netlify function exists and is properly configured

### 4. Apartment Listing Filters ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Current Filters Available**:
- ‚úÖ City/Area
- ‚úÖ Move-in/Move-out Date  
- ‚úÖ Price
- ‚úÖ Property Type (shared-room, private-room, studio, apartment)
- ‚úÖ Amenities (multiple selection)
- ‚úÖ Bed Type (single-bed, double-bed, hochbett)
- ‚úÖ Number of Rooms

**Missing Filters Requested**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced time filters (specific timeframes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced bed type functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Room sharing preferences

**Solution**: Enhance existing filter functionality and add missing options

### 5. Marketplace Button ‚úÖ VERIFIED EXISTS
**Issue**: User claimed "no more marketplace button"
**Analysis**: Button exists at line 965-967 in `frontend/index.html`
```html
<a href="marketplace.html" class="cart-icon" title="Marketplace">
  <i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i>
</a>
```
**Status**: ‚úÖ NO ACTION NEEDED - Button exists and is properly styled

### 6. Mobile Responsiveness ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REVIEW
**Issue**: General mobile design issues reported
**Solution**: Comprehensive mobile CSS review and improvements

### 7. Instruction Guide Missing ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW REQUIREMENT
**Issue**: User wants comprehensive instruction guide
**Solution**: Create detailed user guide page
