### 4. Frontend Components
- **Privacy Policy Page** (`privacy-policy.html`)
- **Privacy Settings Page** (`privacy-settings.html`) 
- **Terms of Service** (`terms-of-service.html`)
- **Cookie Consent Banner** (`js/cookie-consent.js`)

### 5. Automated Systems
- **GDPR Logging Middleware**: Automatically logs data processing activities
- **Data Retention Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired data
- **Consent Tracking**: Records all consent changes with timestamps

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
No additional dependencies are required - all GDPR features use existing packages.

### 2. Initialize GDPR for Existing Users
If you have existing users, run the migration script:
```bash
npm run gdpr:migrate
```

### 3. Add Cookie Consent to Pages
Include the cookie consent script on all pages that use cookies:
```html
<script src="js/cookie-consent.js"></script>
```

### 4. Set Up Scheduled Tasks
Add these to your cron jobs or task scheduler:

**Daily Data Cleanup** (recommended):
```bash
0 2 * * * npm run gdpr:cleanup
```

**Weekly Anonymization** (recommended):
```bash
0 3 * * 0 npm run gdpr:anonymize
```

**Monthly Compliance Report**:
```bash
0 9 1 * * npm run gdpr:report
```

## üìä Management Commands

### Generate Compliance Report
```bash
npm run gdpr:report
```
Generates a comprehensive GDPR compliance report including:
- Active users and consent counts
- Pending GDPR requests
- Data processing activity summary
- Consent breakdown by type

### Run Data Cleanup
```bash
npm run gdpr:cleanup
```
Removes expired data according to retention policies:
- Old data processing logs (1 year)
- Completed GDPR requests (3 years)
- Inactive consent records (3 years)

### Anonymize Old Data
```bash
npm run gdpr:anonymize
```
Anonymizes personal data that has exceeded retention periods:
- Old viewing requests (3+ years)
- Old messages (5+ years)
- Inactive user data

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:
```env
# GDPR Settings
GDPR_DATA_RETENTION_YEARS=5
GDPR_LOG_RETENTION_MONTHS=12
GDPR_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_DAYS=30
ENABLE_GDPR_LOGGING=true
```

### Customizing Retention Periods
Edit the retention periods in `/utils/gdprService.js`:
```javascript
// Example: Change message retention to 2 years
const twoYearsAgo = new Date();
twoYearsAgo.setFullYear(twoYearsAgo.getFullYear() - 2);
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Legal Compliance Features

### Data Processing Legal Basis
The system tracks legal basis for all data processing:
- **Consent**: Marketing, analytics, optional features
- **Contract**: Core platform functionality
- **Legal Obligation**: GDPR requests, compliance
- **Legitimate Interests**: Security, fraud prevention

### Consent Management
- **Granular Consent**: Users can consent to different types of processing
- **Consent Withdrawal**: Easy withdrawal through privacy settings
- **Consent Records**: All consent changes are logged with timestamps
- **Cookie Consent**: GDPR-compliant cookie banner

### Data Subject Rights
- **30-day Response**: GDPR requests are tracked with automatic expiry
- **Identity Verification**: Admin can verify identity before processing sensitive requests
- **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged for compliance auditing

## üìù Privacy Policy Integration

The privacy policy includes:
- Complete data collection disclosure
- Legal basis for each type of processing
- Data retention periods
- User rights explanation
- Contact information for privacy concerns
- Cookie policy with opt-out options

## üîí Security Measures

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to personal data
- **Anonymization**: Automatic anonymization of expired data
- **Secure Deletion**: Proper data deletion for GDPR requests

### Monitoring
- **Processing Logs**: All data access and modifications logged
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regular compliance reports
- **Breach Detection**: Monitoring for unauthorized access

## üìà Admin Dashboard Integration

The admin dashboard now includes:
- **GDPR Requests Queue**: Pending requests with deadlines
- **Compliance Overview**: Key metrics and warnings
- **Data Processing Log**: Recent activity summary
- **User Consent Status**: Consent breakdown and trends

## üîÑ Data Processing Workflow

### User Registration
1. User creates account with basic consent
2. Processing activity logged
3. Welcome email sent (if consented)
4. Consent preferences can be updated

### GDPR Request Processing
1. User submits request through privacy settings
2. Request logged with 30-day deadline
3. Admin receives notification
4. Admin processes request (access/delete/export)
5. User notified of completion
6. Request archived after completion

### Data Retention
1. Daily cleanup removes expired logs
2. Weekly anonymization of old personal data
3. Monthly compliance reports generated
4. Annual review of retention policies

## üö® Important Notes

### Legal Compliance
- This implementation provides technical compliance tools
- Legal review is recommended for specific jurisdictions
- Regular compliance audits are advised
- Data Processing Impact Assessments may be required

### Performance Considerations
- GDPR logging adds minimal overhead
- Database indexes optimize query performance
- Cleanup tasks should run during low-traffic periods
- Large exports may require background processing

### Backup and Recovery
- Ensure GDPR data is included in backups
- Have procedures for data restoration
- Consider backup retention vs. GDPR deletion requirements
- Test recovery procedures regularly

## üìû Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Review compliance reports monthly
- [ ] Update privacy policy as needed
- [ ] Monitor GDPR request response times
- [ ] Audit data processing activities
- [ ] Train staff on GDPR procedures

### Monitoring Alerts
Set up alerts for:
- Overdue GDPR requests
- High volume of data processing
- Failed consent recordings
- Data cleanup errors
