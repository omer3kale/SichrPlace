# Workspace Status Summary

This summary aggregates the active action plans and highlights remaining open items across the SichrPlace repository.

## Active Plans
- `DOCUMENTATION_INVENTORY.md`: Catalogs and deduplicates the documentation wave.
- `BACKEND_DUPLICATION_AUDIT.md`: Tracks consolidation of `backend/` and `js/backend/`.
- `TOOLING_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`: Aligns lint/test configurations and package scripts.
- `NETLIFY_FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`: Covers serverless functions and frontend asset wiring.
- `SUPABASE_DB_OPERATIONS_PLAN.md`: Organizes migrations, seeds, and verification scripts.
- `MARKETPLACE_PAYMENTS_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`: Drives end-to-end verification for marketplace, payments, and viewing flows.
- `COMPLIANCE_MONITORING_PLAN.md`: Establishes evidence, automation, and monitoring for GDPR/security.

## Outstanding Themes
1. **Documentation Cleanup**: Merge/retire duplicate guides and produce a single docs index.
2. **Backend Canonicalization**: Decide on final directory and migrate source/tests accordingly.
3. **Toolchain Consolidation**: Standardize ESLint/Jest configs and command entry points.
4. **Function & Frontend Coverage**: Audit Netlify handlers, add tests, ensure scripts load in production pages.
5. **Database Readiness**: Finalize migration order, add automated verification, and update setup guides.
6. **Marketplace/Payment Validation**: Execute schema/API/UI tests and document PayPal integration proof.
7. **Compliance Assurance**: Collect evidence, automate consent/security checks, and centralize monitoring.

## Next Steps
- Assign owners for each plan and track progress in `PROJECT_STATUS_TRACKER.md`.
- Update CI/CD pipelines once tooling, DB, and compliance automation steps are prepared.
- After each plan reaches “complete,” archive its document or move it under `/docs/archive/`.

This summary will be updated as each action plan moves from “open” to “verified.”
