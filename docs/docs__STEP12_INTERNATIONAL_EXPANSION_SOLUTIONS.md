# Step 12 International Expansion Solutions

This plan translates Step 12 into executable workstreams so SichrPlace supports multi-market operations with localized experiences, payments, and compliance.

## 1. Localization & Multi-Language Support

**Backend Tasks**
- Extend i18n middleware (Step 5 groundwork) to dynamically load locale bundles by region; ensure API responses include localized strings where appropriate.
- Create localization admin API `POST /api/i18n/translations` allowing content managers to update keys; version translations with timestamps.

**Frontend Tasks**
- Implement locale switcher persistent across sessions, storing preference in user profile and local storage.
- Translate core pages (home, listings, dashboard, onboarding) into target languages (e.g., English, German, French); leverage translation keys with fallback logic.
- Localize date/time formats, number formatting, and address inputs per locale.

**Content Operations**
- Set up translation pipeline (e.g., Phrase/Locize) with review workflow, glossary management, and automated bundle export.
- Provide language QA guidelines and schedule community or vendor reviews before release.

## 2. Currency Conversion & Regional Pricing

**Backend Tasks**
- Build `services/currencyService.js` consuming trusted FX API (Open Exchange Rates); cache daily rates in `currencies` table with metadata.
- Support multi-currency listings: store base price plus converted amounts; apply rounding rules and display in userâ€™s preferred currency.
- Handle taxes/fees per region by extending pricing engine to include locale-specific VAT/GST logic.

**Frontend Tasks**
- Add currency selector and automatically display conversions for property prices, fees, and invoices.
- Update booking and payment flows to show detailed breakdowns (base price, conversion rate, taxes) with localized formatting.

## 3. Local Payment Methods & Compliance

- Integrate additional payment providers per region (e.g., SEPA, iDEAL, Klarna) through modular adapters; update checkout to offer localized options.
- Ensure PSP onboarding covers country-specific KYC/AML requirements; store compliance status with audit trails.
- Implement tax invoice generation per jurisdiction with localized templates and required fields (e.g., VAT ID, fiscal code).

## 4. Legal & Regulatory Alignment

- Conduct market-by-market legal review covering tenancy laws, data protection, consumer rights; document requirements in compliance matrix.
- Update Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and consent flows for each region; add locale-specific clauses.
- Enable data residency controls if mandated: configure regional storage buckets and limit cross-border transfers.
- Implement cookie consent management adhering to EU/UK regulations (granular opt-in, proof of consent).

## 5. Support & Operations Enablement

- Train support staff on regional nuances; provide localized macros and escalation paths.
- Offer localized help center articles and chatbot intents (leveraging Step 10 infrastructure) per language.
- Monitor regional KPIs (conversion, booking rates) via segmented dashboards; schedule weekly reviews during launch.
