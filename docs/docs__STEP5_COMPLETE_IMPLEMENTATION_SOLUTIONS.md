# Step 5 Complete Implementation Solutions

This playbook converts the Step 5 plan for advanced platform features and integrations into actionable backend, frontend, infrastructure, and database tasks so that SichrPlace becomes a professional, enterprise-ready platform.

## 1. Advanced Search & Filtering System

**Backend Tasks**
- Integrate Elasticsearch: configure cluster connection, index mapping for apartments and locations[^es]
- Implement geospatial queries in `services/searchService.js` using Elasticsearch Geo API
- Build advanced filters in `routes/search.js`: price, move-in date, amenities, room count, property type
- Capture search analytics: insert into `search_analytics` table via `services/analyticsService.js` after each query
- Auto-suggestions: index and query partial terms in `search_suggestions` index
- Saved search alerts: `POST /api/search/save-alert` triggers email/SMS jobs

**Database Tasks**
- Create tables: `search_analytics`, `popular_searches`, `locations`
- Set up triggers or scheduled tasks to aggregate popular searches into `popular_searches`

**Frontend Tasks**
- Build advanced search page `frontend/advanced-search.html`: filters, map widget, date pickers, amenities toggle
- Integrate autocomplete input: call `GET /api/search/suggestions` on keypress
- Display and paginate results: fetch `GET /api/search/advanced`
- Saved-search UI: form to save criteria, list with edit/delete actions

## 2. Analytics & Reporting Dashboard

**Backend Tasks**
- Instrument user behavior: log page views and events to `user_analytics` via middleware

- Expose endpoints: `GET /api/analytics/dashboard`, `/users`, `/properties`, `/revenue`, `POST /api/analytics/track`

**Database Tasks**
- Create `user_analytics`, `property_analytics`, `platform_metrics` tables
- Build ETL scripts to roll daily metrics into `platform_metrics`
