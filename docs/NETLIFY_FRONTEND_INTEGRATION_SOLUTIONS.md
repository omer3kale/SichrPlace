# Netlify & Frontend Integration Solutions

The following remediation items translate the integration plan into actions grounded in official Netlify guidance and modern frontend performance practices.

## 1. Rationalize the Functions Inventory
- Use the Netlify Functions dashboard to review every deployed handler and retire duplicates (`add-property` vs `add-property-legacy`) or unused prototypes. Netlify keeps an immutable history per deploy, so pruning in Git cleanly deprecates obsolete endpoints while still allowing rollbacks when needed (see Netlify Functions overview, 2025-09-09).
- Group related handlers into subdirectories (`marketplace/*`, `auth/*`) and add `config.path` metadata where routes need friendly URLs. This keeps routing explicit and prevents accidental shadowing of static assets (Netlify Functions get started doc, sections "Route requests" and `preferStatic`).

## 2. Expand Automated Coverage for Functions
- Extend the Jest project that targets `netlify/functions` to cover high-risk handlers (feedback, tenant screening, payments). Add scenario tests that validate required headers, environment lookups, and downstream error handling before deploying to production.
- Adopt Netlify Dev (`netlify dev`) inside CI smoke jobs to simulate the production gateway locally, ensuring redirects, environment scoping, and geo flags behave as expected prior to merge (Netlify Get Started doc, "Test locally").
- Promote test utilities (`__tests__/setup.js`, mock contexts) so they are shared across all new suites, and wire `npm run test:functions` from the root to call the consolidated project (depends on tooling alignment solutions).

## 3. Formalize Environment Variable Management
- Declare PayPal, Supabase, SMTP, and analytics secrets through the Netlify UI/CLI with the Functions scope enabled. Values defined in `netlify.toml` are not exposed to runtime handlers, so they must be registered via the environment management API (Netlify environment variables doc, "Declare variables").
- Document read-only values (`SITE_NAME`, `URL`, etc.) that handlers can rely on, and enforce a validation helper at function startup to fail fast when required variables are missing (same doc, "Netlify read-only variables").
- Include an `.env.example` illustrating local fallback keys used by Netlify Dev. The actual secrets stay in Netlify but developers can override them with `netlify env:import` during onboarding.

## 4. Tighten Deployment and Monitoring Workflow
- Update `netlify/package.json` to expose `npm run functions:deploy` (wrapping `netlify deploy` with the appropriate flags) and `npm run functions:logs` (streaming via `netlify logs functions`). Encourage release managers to verify bundles and tail logs immediately after each production deploy (Netlify Get Started doc, "Next steps").
- Capture function metrics and logs inside the existing compliance dashboard so runtime errors are surfaced alongside backend alerts (Netlify Functions overview references the Functions tab for per-deploy history).

## 5. Align Frontend Asset Loading with Performance Guidance
- Inventory every `<script>` tag across HTML templates and ensure new widgets (`feedback-widget.js`, `availability-monitor.js`) are either referenced or intentionally excluded. Remove dead files to avoid drift.
- Introduce a lightweight bundler (e.g., Vite or Rollup) with code-splitting so that only the entry scripts required for initial rendering are shipped on first paint. Googleâ€™s web.dev guidance shows that reducing initial JavaScript payloads lowers INP and LCP by freeing the main thread ("Reduce JavaScript payloads with code splitting").
- Configure the bundler to produce hashed filenames and emit preload hints for critical chunks. Add a smoke test that loads each built HTML page in headless Chrome to verify the presence of required widgets and absence of blocking errors.

## 6. Establish Frontend Test Coverage
- Stand up a Jest + JSDOM suite (or Playwright if DOM APIs are insufficient) under `frontend/__tests__` that validates language switching, form submission, and PWA initialization. This complements the Netlify smoke tests and ensures widget regressions are caught.
- Tie the new suite into the root `npm test` pipeline, keeping parity with the tooling alignment recommendations so the entire Netlify + frontend surface runs on every pull request.
