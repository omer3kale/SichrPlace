# Step 10 AI & Machine Learning Solutions

This roadmap converts Step 10 ambitions into concrete delivery tasks so SichrPlace activates AI-powered features responsibly.

## 1. Conversational Support Chatbot

**Backend Tasks**
- Stand up `services/chatbotService.js` integrating with an LLM provider (OpenAI/Azure OpenAI) via REST SDK; implement rate limiting, request logging, and content filtering.[^openai]
- Build dialogue orchestration: maintain conversational state in Redis keyed by session, inject context (FAQs, property data) using retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
- Expose APIs `POST /api/support/chat` for user messages and `GET /api/support/history` for transcripts; secure with auth middleware and redact PII before storage.

**Data Tasks**
- Create vector index (Pinecone/pgvector) containing FAQ entries, documentation, and property metadata; refresh nightly from CMS.
- Implement feedback capture (`thumbs up/down`) to label responses and feed continuous improvement pipelines.

**Frontend Tasks**
- Embed chat widget with typing indicators, conversation history, escalation button to human support, and offline fallback.

## 2. Image Recognition for Property Verification

**Pipeline Tasks**
- Implement image ingestion workflow: upload to object storage, trigger serverless function or queue worker to run computer vision checks (blur detection, watermark detection, room classification) using Vision API or custom ML model.[^vision]
- Store results in `image_verifications` table with confidence scores, manual review flags, and audit logs.
- Surface verification status in landlord dashboard; provide remediation guidance for rejected photos.

**Model Lifecycle**
- Train classification models using labeled dataset (room types, quality) leveraging AutoML or custom training; version artifacts in MLflow and keep metadata in `ai_models`.
- Monitor precision/recall; set thresholds for auto-approve vs manual review and schedule retraining when drift detected.

## 3. Price Prediction & Smart Recommendations

**Data Engineering**
- Build ETL pipeline aggregating historical rentals, location factors, seasonality, and property attributes into feature store tables (`features_price`, `features_demand`).
- Apply feature normalization and store in monthly snapshots for reproducibility.

**Modeling**
- Train regression models (XGBoost/LightGBM) for price prediction; evaluate with cross-validation and backtesting against actual bookings.
- Enhance recommendation engine (Step 6) with hybrid approach: collaborative filtering + content-based using embeddings; deploy inference endpoint `GET /api/recommendations/insights` returning predicted price range and match score.

**Integration**
- Update landlord UI with pricing suggestions, confidence intervals, and actionable tips; log user interactions for reinforcement.
- Provide tenants with “value score” badges highlighting fair deals based on predicted vs listed price.

## 4. Fraud Detection & Risk Mitigation

- Design anomaly detection pipeline monitoring suspicious activities (rapid account creations, payment anomalies, high-risk IP ranges) using unsupervised models (Isolation Forest) and rule engine.
- Route high-risk events to `risk_alerts` queue for manual review; integrate with notification system.
- Document escalation SOPs for fraudulent activity; ensure compliance with privacy regulations and data retention policies.

## 5. Governance, Ethics & Compliance

- Establish AI governance board defining usage policies, bias checks, and explainability requirements; document in `docs/`.
- Perform model fairness audits (e.g., disparate impact) and publish transparency reports.
- Implement opt-in experiences for AI-driven features, offering manual overrides and clear user education.
- Maintain dataset lineage and consent tracking; respect GDPR/DSGVO requirements for data deletion and subject access.

## Timeline & Ownership

| Window | Deliverable | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | Chatbot MVP (RAG pipeline, API, widget), data ingestion scaffolding | Backend + Data Engineering |
| Week 2 | Image verification workflow, dashboards, manual review tooling | Backend + Data Science |
| Week 3 | Price prediction & recommendation upgrades with UI integration | Data Science + Frontend |
| Week 4 | Fraud detection, governance docs, monitoring & rollout | Security + Compliance |

## Exit Criteria

- Chatbot handles majority of support inquiries with clear escalation, feedback loops, and monitored quality metrics.
- Image verification pipeline classifies uploads accurately, reducing manual review while flagging edge cases.
- Pricing and recommendation models deliver measurable lift in booking conversions and user satisfaction.
- Fraud detection alerts surface high-risk events with documented mitigation workflows, and AI governance policies maintain compliance.
