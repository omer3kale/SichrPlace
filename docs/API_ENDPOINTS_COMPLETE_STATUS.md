---

## üîß COMPLETED UPDATES

### 1. ‚úÖ Core Property Management APIs

#### **`/netlify/functions/add-property.mjs`** - FULLY UPDATED
- **German Rental Fields**: Full support for Kaltmiete, Nebenkosten, Kaution structure
- **German Address**: Stra√üe, Hausnummer, PLZ, Ort, Bundesland format
- **Energy Certificates**: German Energieausweis standards (A+ to H classes)
- **Rental Features**: M√∂bliert, Haustiere, Rauchen policies
- **Validation**: German PLZ format (5 digits), rental market requirements
- **Response**: Includes calculated Warmmiete and formatted German addresses

#### **`/netlify/functions/apartments.mjs`** - FULLY UPDATED  
- **Advanced Filtering**: German location (PLZ, Bundesland), pricing (Kaltmiete/Warmmiete)
- **Feature Filtering**: M√∂bliert, Haustiere, Stellplatz, Energieeffizienzklasse
- **Response Format**: All apartments include German rental calculations and formatting
- **Backward Compatibility**: Automatic parameter mapping from legacy names

#### **`/netlify/functions/search.mjs`** - FULLY UPDATED
- **Full-Text Search**: Across all German fields (Ort, Stra√üe, Titel, Beschreibung)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Complete German rental market filter support
- **Location Intelligence**: PLZ-based search, Bundesland filtering
- **Rental Calculations**: Warmmiete filtering and sorting capabilities

### 2. ‚úÖ Backend Service Layer

#### **`ApartmentService.js`** - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN
- **Field Transformation**: Automatic mapping between legacy and German schema
- **German Calculations**: Warmmiete computation, formatted addresses
- **Advanced Filtering**: Support for all German rental market parameters
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for existing frontend code

#### **`ViewingRequestService.js`** - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN  
- **German Terminology**: Mieter/Vermieter, Besichtigungsgeb√ºhr, Zahlungsstatus
- **German Dates**: Gew√ºnschter Termin formatting
- **Payment Integration**: ‚Ç¨25 default viewing fee system
- **Status Management**: German status displays and workflows

#### **`GoogleMapsService.js`** - HIGH RISK, NEEDS HARDENING  
- **Mixes Frontend Concepts**: Ships marker rendering/DOM helpers inside the backend bundle; nothing guards against these stubs being invoked server-side.
- **Unbounded Google API Proxy**: Directly fetches Maps/Places/Distance APIs with the shared key, has no rate limiting, caching, or auth checks, and logs raw failures.
- **Database Hot Path**: `findNearbyApartments` loads *all* apartments then filters in JS, so production datasets will blow past lambda memory/timeout limits.
- **Cache/Redis Assumptions**: Reuses helpers like `calculateHaversineDistance` everywhere but never checks whether dependent cache layers or table columns exist.

#### **`UserService.js`** - BROKEN EXPORT, SECURITY GAPS  
- **Overwritten Methods**: Duplicate class definitions at the bottom replace working implementations with aliases that call missing helpers (`getById`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser`), so `findById`/`update`/`delete` throw at runtime.
- **Plaintext Credentials**: Persists `password` and verification tokens directly to the `users` table instead of delegating to Supabase Auth or hashing first.
- **Lockout Drift**: Multiple tracking helpers compete (`trackFailedLogin`, `resetFailedLogins`) without a single source of truth, risking inconsistent account states.
- **Service-Key Dependency**: Still relies on the service-role client from `../config/supabase`, so any call bypasses RLS and requires env secrets even for public workflows.

#### **`.netlify/functions-serve/*/___netlify-telemetry.mjs`** - BUILD ARTIFACTS CHECKED IN  
- **Generated Stubs**: Every Netlify dev server folder contains a 3-line telemetry shim that just imports `createRequire`; none ship business logic but they inflate repo size.
- **No Runtime Value**: Keeping 50+ duplicates under version control offers no diagnostics insight and slows audits because they look like real functions.
- **Recommended Action**: Add `.netlify/` to `.gitignore`, purge these artifacts from the repo, and rely on Netlify CLI to regenerate them locally.

### 3. ‚úÖ Database Schema Integration

#### **German Rental Database** - FULLY DEPLOYED LOCALLY

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT PHASE

### 1. **Frontend Updates** (High Priority)
- Update HTML forms to include German rental fields
- Maintain existing design while adding German functionality
- Add Kaltmiete/Warmmiete display toggles
- Implement German address autocomplete

### 2. **Additional API Reviews** (Medium Priority)
```bash
# Files that may need review:
- booking-requests.mjs
- messages.mjs  
- reviews.mjs
- favorites.mjs
- recently-viewed.mjs
- `netlify/functions/utils/field-mapper.mjs`
  - Central alias registry that maps canonical (English) apartment/user/review fields to their German legacy column names.
  - `map*ToFrontend` helpers clone records and optionally keep legacy keys to avoid frontend regressions; `applyAliasesForWrite` mirrors canonical values back into legacy columns.
  - `buildOrCondition` and `mirrorAliasesIntoPayload` are used by Netlify functions to fan out filters/payloads across every alias, so any new canonical field must be added here to stay query-safe.
- `netlify/functions/tenant-screening-employment.mjs`
  - Full Supabase-backed flow for employment verification: stores payload in `employment_verifications`, re-processes it, and emits an audit row in `tenant_screening_logs`.
  - Risk scoring and rent-rule enforcement exist, but the "verification" step is just `Math.random()` with a 3‚Äì8‚ÄØs delay; approvals are effectively random once documentation is uploaded.
  - Missing hard validation on `monthlyRent` or upload URLs means NaN income ratios/slack webhook-style URLs can pass straight into the database; nothing sanitises the uploaded document metadata.
  - Uses the public anon key for all Supabase writes‚Äîworks only if RLS is disabled for the target tables, otherwise every insert/update will fail silently in production.
- `netlify/functions/tenant-screening-financial.mjs`
  - Switchboard Netlify function that multiplexes five actions (`validate-income`, `upload-documents`, etc.) off the final path segment, but only `validateIncomeRequirements`, `calculateAffordability`, and `getFinancialQualification` actually exist‚Äîthe upload/verify branches crash with `ReferenceError`.
  - Stores a detailed affordability record in `financial_qualifications` and logs to `tenant_screening_logs`, again via the anon key; any RLS on those tables breaks the flow.
  - Rent-to-income math assumes all numeric fields are numbers, yet blindly subtracts string payloads, so malformed JSON can leak `NaN` into Supabase; there‚Äôs no clamp against absurd values or document payload size.
  - Mock market data and tax estimates are presented as real output (e.g., `calculateNetIncome` hardcodes tax brackets), so the API returns authoritative-sounding guidance that‚Äôs actually just placeholder logic.
- `netlify/functions/tenant-screening-references.mjs`
  - Similar router pattern for landlord references: only the JSON-based helpers exist; verification emails/token handling are console stubs, so "landlord" verification is essentially self-reported data.
  - Writes to `landlord_reference_checks`, `individual_landlord_references`, and `tenant_screening_logs` using the anon key, meaning Supabase RLS must be fully disabled for these tables in production.
  - `sendReferenceVerificationEmail` just logs a verification URL and `setTimeout`‚Äîno mailer, no signing, and the token is a predictable timestamp + `Math.random()` string easily brute-forced.
  - No throttling or validation on reference submission: a tenant can submit 100 references in one request and spam every landlord, or inject arbitrary JSON into `references_data` because inputs aren‚Äôt sanitized.
- `netlify/functions/tenant-screening-schufa.mjs`
  - Mimics a SCHUFA credit pull but only calls `simulateSchufaAPI`; every score/decision is random within 650‚Äì900 and stored as if it were an official response.
  - Again uses the Supabase anon key to insert into `schufa_checks` and `tenant_screening_logs`; any production RLS rules will block the writes.
  - Minimal input validation: `address`/`city`/`identityDocumentUrl` aren‚Äôt sanitized, and `postalCode` is only regex-checked, so malicious data flows straight into long-term storage.
  - Credit scores below 600 are treated as failures but the random generator rarely drops that low, so the API reports high approval rates that mislead downstream workflows.
- `netlify/functions/booking-requests.mjs`
  - Uses the Supabase **service role** key plus a JWT secret fallback of `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_here'`; if the env var is missing, any attacker can mint a token and gain full-table access.
  - No validation on date order, guest counts, or duplicate requests‚Äîspamming the endpoint fills `booking_requests` with overlapping entries without conflict checks.
  - Landlord approval path trusts the decoded JWT `id` and the service-role client, so forged tokens let tenants approve/reject other users‚Äô bookings.
  - Error handling leaks internal Supabase errors to logs but not responses; a 500 response is the only feedback clients receive when inserts/updates fail.
- `netlify/functions/business-intelligence-analytics.mjs`
  - Entirely static JSON dressed up as analytics results; POST actions just echo canned payloads and invent download URLs like `https://reports.sichrplace.netlify.app/...` with no backing service.
  - No auth, rate limiting, or input validation‚Äîanyone can generate unlimited ‚Äúreports‚Äù or ‚Äúforecasts,‚Äù creating misleading telemetry in downstream dashboards.
  - Numerical fields use plain JS floats (e.g., `125420.50`) but there‚Äôs no persistence, so consumers may assume the data is sourced from a BI warehouse when it‚Äôs hardcoded.
  - Missing error logging; failures only return a generic 500 with the thrown message, offering no traceability.
- `netlify/functions/cache-management.mjs`
  - Relies on a process-level `Map`, so every cold start wipes cache entries and horizontally scaled functions never share state; operators see phantom persistence.
  - Unauthenticated callers can `get`, `list_keys`, `flush`, or `delete` anything, which is effectively a public cache-busting gadget.
  - Builds `RegExp(pattern)` from user input‚Äîcrafted catastrophic backtracking expressions can pin the event loop and exhaust the lambda budget.
  - `calculateSize` leans on the browser `Blob` API (missing in many Netlify Node runtimes) before falling back to naive JSON length, so binary or circular payloads break the handler.
- `netlify/functions/cache-optimization.mjs`
  - Every metric (hit rate, evictions, region sizes) is hardcoded text; there‚Äôs zero connection to real cache telemetry.
  - POST actions only echo success strings‚Äîno cache invalidation, warming, or clearing actually happens.
  - DELETE claims success regardless of parameters, encouraging ops teams to trust a noop endpoint.
  - No authentication, so anyone can spam fake cache events and generate noisy audit logs if hooked into dashboards.
- `netlify/functions/chats.mjs`
  - Uses the Supabase service-role key plus a fallback JWT secret `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_here'`, meaning forged tokens expose/modify all chat data.
  - GET handlers return full transcripts and participant emails without verifying the requester is part of the conversation.
  - POST accepts arbitrary `receiverId`, letting attackers open chats with any user or spray hundreds of messages through privileged inserts.
  - Assumes service-role access to `chats`/`chat_messages`; with RLS enabled the code 500s, otherwise it bypasses every policy entirely.
- `netlify/functions/compliance-reporting.mjs`
  - Ships a canned 98% compliance dashboard that isn‚Äôt backed by audits or storage, risking regulatory misrepresentation.
  - Generates fake report/export IDs and download URLs instead of producing artifacts, so compliance teams think paperwork exists when it doesn‚Äôt.
  - No auth or throttling‚Äîanyone can pull ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù compliance data or request bogus privacy exports indefinitely.
  - Catch block just surfaces `error.message`, leaving no audit trail or context for failed compliance actions.
- `netlify/functions/configuration-management.mjs`
  - Responds with fabricated configuration/feature-flag payloads rather than real environment state.
  - POST/PUT paths acknowledge updates but persist nothing, guaranteeing drift between dashboards and production settings.
  - Leaks internal quotas, rate limits, and feature toggles to unauthenticated callers.
  - Offers no auth, auditing, or version control, so even legitimate admins can‚Äôt trust it.
- `netlify/functions/consent-management.mjs`
  - Publishes GDPR consent CRUD over the service-role key with zero authentication, exposing sensitive audit logs.
  - Helper functions reference `event.headers` despite never receiving `event`, causing `ReferenceError` before any records are touched.
  - Assumes large tables (`user_consents`, `consent_audit_log`, `data_processing_activities`) and JSON columns exist; missing schema immediately crashes the function.
  - Bulk operations iterate sequentially with no throttling, so crafted payloads can hammer the database/service-role limits.
- `netlify/functions/content-moderation.mjs`
  - Admin auth relies on JWTs signed with the same fallback secret, letting attackers forge `is_admin: true` tokens and run the entire moderation suite.
  - Performs destructive service-role actions (ban users, delete apartments/reviews) without transactions or approval workflows.
  - `review_reports` and similar endpoints expose reporter/defendant PII because the service key bypasses RLS and returns raw joins.
  - A 1k-line surface area that assumes dozens of tables/columns exist; any schema drift or RLS instantly drops the function into 500s.
- `netlify/functions/conversations.mjs`
  - Launches a sprawling messaging CRM on the service-role key with a fallback JWT secret, so forged tokens unlock every conversation action.
  - GET handlers fetch entire conversation payloads (participants, metadata, last message) for any supplied ID‚Äîno check that the caller belongs to the thread.
  - Unread-count logic tries to stuff a correlated subquery into `.gt()` which Supabase rejects, leaving the function to log errors and return bogus counts.
  - Mutation routes (`add_participant`, `delete_conversation`, `archive_conversation`, etc.) trust caller-supplied IDs and never wrap writes in transactions, so race conditions or malicious inputs corrupt shared threads.
- `netlify/functions/csrf-token.mjs`
  - Spins up a service-role client but never uses it; the token generator is entirely edge-local.
  - Returns the CSRF token in both the response body and a cookie, defeating the point of a secret anti-CSRF token.
  - Cookie is stamped `HttpOnly` yet the JSON payload echoes the nonce, so scripts can still grab it; there‚Äôs no server-side store to validate tokens later.
  - No rate limiting or binding to a session identifier, so attackers can mint unlimited tokens and replay them against any form.
- `netlify/functions/data-migration-utilities.mjs`
  - Public endpoint advertises migrations/exports backed only by canned JSON; no auth or database work occurs.
  - POST actions (`run_migration`, `rollback_migration`, `export_data`, `import_data`) just echo success strings and plausible IDs‚Äîoperations never touch Supabase.
  - Hardcodes optimistic flags like `rollback_supported: true`, giving teams false confidence about recovery paths.
  - Still initialises the service-role client even though no queries run, widening the blast radius if someone later plugs in dynamic SQL.
- `netlify/functions/database-administration.mjs`
  - Exposes database host, engine version, table sizes, and query counts to the public with zero authentication‚Äîfriendly intel for attackers.
  - POST `execute_query` claims to run arbitrary SQL with the service-role key and always returns success, inviting anyone to assume their statements executed.
  - Other admin actions (`vacuum_table`, `optimize_indexes`) are no-ops that just fabricate task IDs; ops teams could rely on maintenance that never happened.
  - Service-role client is live, so swapping the stub for real execution would hand full DDL power to unauthenticated callers.
- `netlify/functions/deployment-management.mjs`
  - Entire deployment history and success metrics are static fiction; no CI/CD integration feeds the data.
  - POST actions (`deploy`, `rollback`, `preview`) only mint fake IDs/URLs and don‚Äôt verify authentication, so anyone can trigger bogus ‚Äúdeployments.‚Äù
  - Advertising 100% success and instant rollbacks misleads leadership while hiding the lack of real automation.
  - Returns Netlify build commands/environments publicly, signalling internal tooling to outsiders.
- `netlify/functions/development-debugging-tools.mjs`
  - Reads like an engineering control panel but every metric/test toggle is hardcoded; no pipelines or linters are invoked.
  - Anyone can POST `run_tests`/`build_project`/`profile_performance` and receive success responses pointing to non-existent artifacts.
  - Encourages teams to skip real QA because the endpoint reports 95% coverage and green builds regardless of reality.
  - Lacks authentication, so attackers can flood fake test/build jobs and pollute any observability hooked to these responses.
- `netlify/functions/email-management.mjs`
  - Service-role Supabase client combined with fallback JWT secret exposes every email template/log to forged tokens.
  - Typo `nodemailer.createTransporter` throws at runtime, so every send path crashes before dispatching mail.
  - `renderEmailTemplate` uses naive `new RegExp('{{key}}','g')` replacements‚Äîvariable values containing regex metacharacters break rendering or enable ReDoS.
  - Inserts raw recipient lists and template HTML into Supabase without sanitisation, so a compromised token can mass-mail or exfiltrate sensitive correspondence.
  - Bulk send/queue routes offer no rate limiting or provider quotas, letting a single call try to blast thousands of emails via privileged credentials.
- `netlify/functions/email-notifications.mjs`
  - Initialises Nodemailer via nonexistent `createTransporter`, crashing before any email leaves the queue.
  - Runs entirely on the service-role key with no auth checks, so anonymous callers can read/write notifications and fire mass mail.
  - Uses user-controlled HTML straight in email bodies and stores notification payloads without sanitisation, extending XSS/phishing risk.
  - Notification preference checks happen after the DB insert, so even opted-out users still get rows (and possibly emails) before the early return shuts down delivery.
- `netlify/functions/email-service.mjs`
  - Same `createTransporter` typo brings down every send attempt; queued workflows can never deliver.
  - Writes full template HTML/JSON into `email_logs` using the service-role key and trusts inbound template names‚Äîattackers can dump arbitrary blobs or re-send sensitive templates.
  - Template rendering uses naive string substitution with no escaping, so untrusted values inject HTML/JS or break layout.
  - No auth or rate limits; anyone can POST and blast transactional templates to arbitrary addresses with privileged SMTP creds.
- `netlify/functions/enterprise-platform-overview.mjs`
  - Canned ‚Äú85 functions operational‚Äù dashboard gives leadership false confidence; none of the metrics come from real monitoring.
  - POST actions mint fake health checks, scaling runs, and optimization IDs with zero authentication, so outsiders can fabricate operational history.
  - Advertises internal topology (categories, scaling model, toolchain) publicly, leaking architecture intel to attackers.
  - Never touches Supabase or observability backends despite claiming complete coverage.
- `netlify/functions/enterprise-solutions.mjs`
  - Pretends to provision tenants/SSO/branding but only returns synthetic IDs and URLs; no backend state changes happen.
  - Unauthenticated POST lets anyone request ‚Äútenant‚Äù creation, leaking chosen names/domains into logs and offering footprint for spoofing.
  - Publishes supposed security certifications/support tiers without verification, misleading enterprise buyers.
  - Lacks auditing or persistence, so operations teams can‚Äôt reconcile which tenants/configs actually exist.
- `netlify/functions/error-tracking.mjs`
  - Runs on the service-role key and logs every browser error straight into `error_logs` plus `console.error`, storing whatever PII clients send.
  - No authentication or rate limiting‚Äîattackers can flood the log with junk or sensitive payloads.
  - Serialises `additionalData` with `JSON.stringify` so objects containing BigInts or cyclical refs blow up the handler.
  - Returns 200 even when the database insert fails, hiding outages from monitoring and leaving teams blind.
- `netlify/functions/external-api-integrations.mjs`
  - Netlify stub now points teams to the real `/api/integration-health` backend endpoint for authoritative readiness data.
  - Express route performs live checks against PayPal, Gmail, Cloudinary, Google Maps, and Web Push credentials plus frontend wiring.
  - Backed by automated coverage in `js/backend/tests/integration-health.test.js`, ensuring the matrix reflects actual connectivity.
- `netlify/functions/favorites.mjs`
  - Forces callers to use the service-role client even for reads, so compromised tokens bypass RLS and expose every renter‚Äôs wish list.
  - `deleteFavorite` trusts `event.path` parsing‚Äîin Netlify that includes the full route, so crafted paths can delete unintended rows or throw.
  - Depends on `./utils/field-mapper.mjs` outside the functions bundle; Netlify builds typically miss relative `./utils` when they live in sibling dirs.
  - Toggle logic executes two round-trips without transactions, so concurrent calls can double-insert or double-delete favorites.
```

### 3. **Model Updates** (Low Priority)

## üö® Diagnostics Snapshot (2025-09-30)

| File | Problem Summary | Recommended Fix |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `js/backend/api/favorites.js` | Instantiates its own Supabase client and calls `process.exit(1)` if env keys are missing; exposes only `/` while integration tests call `/api/favorites/:userId`. | Reuse shared Supabase config, return HTTP 503 instead of exiting, and add a `/:userId` handler (or align tests). |
| `js/backend/api/notifications.js`, `saved-searches.js`, `recently-viewed.js`, `profile.js` | Duplicate Supabase bootstrap blocks with inline secrets; each file repeats JWT auth logic and `profile.js` depends on `multer`. | Centralize Supabase/auth middleware, pull secrets from env, and ensure `multer` is installed/guarded. |
| `js/backend/api/feedback.js` | Refers to `ADMIN_TOKEN` and `Feedback` model that are never imported, causing `/download` + DELETE routes to crash. | Import missing pieces or temporarily disable the routes. |
| `js/backend/api/secure-videos.js` | Upload route fails under test with ‚Äúmulter is not a function,‚Äù signalling the dependency isn‚Äôt loaded or is mocked away. | Confirm `multer` dependency, avoid Jest overrides, and optionally lazy-load the module. |
| `js/backend/api/send-message.js` | Handler expects `req.user` but never applies the auth middleware. | Wrap route with `authenticateToken` or guard for anonymous access. |
| `js/backend/api/viewing-request.js` | `router.post('/viewing-request', ‚Ä¶)` plus server mount at `/api/viewing-request` yields `/api/viewing-request/viewing-request`; `EmailService` may still be unready because its constructor is async. | Change to `router.post('/', ‚Ä¶)` and add a readiness check for `EmailService`. |
| `js/backend/api/viewing-request-improved.js`, `viewing-request-old.js` | Heavy Gmail + PayPal integrations throw when credentials are absent. | Gate execution behind env checks and return clear 503s when unset. |
| `js/backend/api/push-notifications.js` | Calls `process.exit(1)` when VAPID/Supabase env vars are missing. | Replace exits with logged warnings + HTTP 503. |
| `js/backend/services/ViewingRequestService.js` | Assumes German Supabase schema exists; missing views/tables bubble up as raw errors. | Validate schema on startup and translate failures into user-friendly responses. |
| `js/backend/services/GoogleMapsService.js` | Backend ships 600+ lines of frontend map helpers, fires unauthenticated Google Maps/Places fetches with the shared key, and scans the entire `apartments` table in JS before filtering. | Split UI helpers from the backend service, hide the API key behind an authenticated proxy with quota controls, and replace table-wide scans with geospatial queries or RPCs. |
| `js/backend/services/MessageService.js` | `getUnreadCount` uses an unsupported Supabase subquery and can throw for non-`PGRST116` errors. | Rework the count query (two queries or RPC) and harden error handling. |
| `js/backend/services/emailService.js` | Constructor fires async `initializeTransporter()` without awaiting; callers may use the service before transporter is ready. | Expose an async `init()` or await a readiness promise before sending mail. |
| `js/backend/services/UserService.js` | Class redeclares `findById`/`update`/`delete` at the bottom so they call missing helpers (`getById`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser`); also writes plaintext passwords/tokens straight to Supabase using the service role key. | Delete the duplicate method block, delegate auth to Supabase Auth (or hash credentials), and ensure the service only runs with least-privileged keys. |
| `js/backend/services/UserService.backup2.js` | Merge conflict markers left dangling (`module.exports` appears twice) so the class definition is followed by raw garbage code; RPC helpers assume database functions exist and will throw when they do not. | Remove the stray code block, verify the RPC path exists before calling it, and keep the backup file outside the bundle if it isn‚Äôt production-ready. |
| `.netlify/functions-serve/*/___netlify-telemetry.mjs` | 50+ generated telemetry shims are checked in, each just re-exporting `createRequire` with no logic, cluttering the repo and confusing audits. | Delete the `.netlify` tree from version control and ignore it so only real function code is tracked. |
| `js/backend/utils/mailer.js` | Throws immediately if `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` is missing. | Guard against missing credentials, returning 503 instead of crashing. |
| `js/backend/services/AdvancedSearchService.js` | Chains multiple `.or()` calls on the same query (Supabase keeps only the last), so filters override each other; also assumes JSON `amenities` column exists. | Collapse OR filters into one expression and guard against missing columns, returning clear errors. |
| `js/backend/services/AnalyticsDashboardService.js` | Calls RPC/tables (`get_search_stats`, `popular_searches`, `search_locations`) that aren‚Äôt provisioned in dev, leading to 500s. | Add existence checks and fall back to mock data or empty stats when tables/procs are absent. |
| `js/backend/services/ApartmentService.js` | Filters rely on columns like `kaltmiete_plus_nebenkosten` and status `verfuegbar` that don‚Äôt exist in current schema. | Update queries to use actual columns/RPCs or compute warm rent in code before filtering. |
| `js/backend/services/DatabasePerformanceService.js` | Uses Redis cache helpers (`cacheService.setWithExpiry`, `.getCacheStats`) that aren‚Äôt implemented and references columns (`requester_id`, `landlord_id`) removed in German schema. | Align with available Redis API, update column names, and guard against missing Supabase views. |
| `js/backend/services/RealtimeChatService.js` | Keeps a singleton service-role channel subscribed to every conversation, so stateless HTTP workers leak sockets, presence tracking never cleans up, and any caller can insert/read messages for conversations they don‚Äôt own. | Handle realtime per authenticated user (or via Supabase client SDK), enforce conversation membership on writes, and remove long-lived service-role subscriptions from the backend. |
| `js/backend/services/DirectionsService.js` | Depends on Google Maps key and Redis cache; if env vars or cache methods are missing it throws, and the file now exports two different `calculateCommuteScores` implementations (one expects arrays of work locations, the other a single location) so the latter silently overrides the former. | Validate `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`/cache availability up front, collapse the duplicate commute scorer into one guarded implementation, and return 503 when dependencies are unavailable. |
| `js/backend/services/GeocodingService.js` | Same Google Maps + Redis dependencies; methods call `setWithExpiry` which isn‚Äôt present in our cache service and will throw. | Provide wrappers that fall back when cache helpers are missing and short-circuit when API keys aren‚Äôt configured. |
| `js/backend/services/PlacesService.js` | Google Places proxy lacks auth/rate limits, trusts shared API key, and writes to Redis via `setWithExpiry`/`getCacheStats` helpers that may not exist; market-analytics helpers assume Google responses always contain price levels and opening hours. | Require server-side auth/quotas before hitting Google, guard cache helpers, degrade gracefully when optional fields are absent, and stop exposing the raw API key. |
| `organized/env/.env.production` | Commits real Supabase service-role key, PayPal secret, Gmail user, JWT secret, and Google Maps key into the repo; anyone cloning the repo can mint admin tokens or drain API quota, and the Supabase keys must now be considered compromised. | Delete committed env files, rotate every exposed secret, and rely on Netlify/OS-level secret managers instead of checked-in `.env` artifacts. |
| `supabase/functions/analytics/index.ts` | Edge function initializes `createClient` with the service-role key and exposes analytics endpoints (`track`, `dashboard`, etc.) without authentication; any caller can insert arbitrary analytics rows, trigger RPCs, and exfiltrate user activity. | Swap to the anon key with RLS-aware policies, add auth + input validation, and move privileged analytics writes behind backend services or RPCs guarded by role checks. |
| `supabase/functions/apartment-search/index.ts` | Apartment search edge handler queries Supabase with the service key, returns landlord PII (name/email) over a public endpoint, and proxies Google Maps requests with our production key‚Äîno auth, rate limiting, or quota guardrails. | Require authenticated callers, limit returned landlord fields, transition to anon-key access with RLS, and move Google integrations to a server-side service that hides the API key behind caching/quotas. |
| `supabase/functions/mobile/index.ts` | Giant mobile/PWA edge bundle runs entirely unauthenticated with the service-role key, sends mock push notifications, syncs private tables (`messages`, `viewing_requests`, `user_locations`), and uploads camera photos straight to the public storage bucket. | Lock the function behind real auth, replace mock push helpers with actual integrations, restrict data access via backend services, and gate storage uploads with signed URLs + validation. |
| `supabase/functions/notifications/index.ts` | Accepts arbitrary notification payloads, reads sensitive joins, inserts into `notifications`, and broadcasts over Supabase realtime using the service-role key‚Äîanyone can impersonate system events or spam users. | Move notification orchestration to a backend service with authenticated callers, throttle requests, and ensure realtime channels/auth are enforced; stop exposing the service key. |
| `supabase/functions/performance/index.ts` | Exposes powerful maintenance RPCs (`cleanup_old_analytics`, `optimize_tables`) plus cached analytics over a public endpoint, all powered by the service-role key; in-memory cache resets per invocation and there‚Äôs no auth. | Require privileged auth before running performance routines, execute them via scheduled backend jobs instead of public edge functions, and remove the service-role key from the runtime. |
| `supabase/migrations/20250929000001_clean_schema_migration.sql` | Nukes the entire database (drops `users`, `apartments`, etc.), recreates legacy password columns, and ships RLS policies that only cover `SELECT`, leaving inserts/updates open or broken. | Treat this as a destructive reset script, keep it out of automated pipelines, and rebuild a minimal migration set that preserves data, hashed auth, and complete policy coverage. |
| `supabase/migrations/20250929000002_german_rental_platform_schema.sql` | Same wipe-and-reseed script but with 700 lines of German tables; still stores `password`, adds computed warm rent columns without indexes, and assumes PostGIS while dropping every production table. | Replace with incremental migrations that extend the live schema, require PostGIS only when available, and remove legacy password handling in favour of Supabase Auth. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20241227100000_core_platform_migration.sql` | ‚ÄúBackup‚Äù rebuild mixes columns from multiple eras (plaintext `password`, duplicate `message` field) and seeds a hard-coded admin account, so re-running on prod can corrupt schema and recreate the leaked admin user. | Archive this script outside migrations, and rebuild canonical migrations that map to Supabase Auth without seeding privileged users. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20241227110000_fix_account_creation.sql` | Alters tables inside anonymous DO blocks then inserts a throwaway user every run, guaranteeing unique email collisions and leaving debug test accounts in production. | Replace with idempotent migrations that skip test data and run in transactions; handle schema drift via versioned change scripts instead. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20250922_tenant_screening_schema.sql` | Drops 200+ columns of sensitive screening data into public schema, enables PostGIS, and opens RLS policies so landlords can read applicants‚Äô SCHUFA details. | Move screening tables into a dedicated schema with encrypted storage, require feature flags, and lock policies to backoffice services only. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20250924_add_rent_type_column.sql` | Adds `rent_type` after the fact without coordinating with the German schema (which renamed pricing columns), so new code branches disagree on field names. | Consolidate pricing fields into one migration path (kalt/warm vs. kaltmiete/warmmiete) and expose a compatibility view for legacy queries. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20250926000001_add_verification_token.sql` | Reintroduces `verification_token_hash`/`verified` columns even when Supabase Auth already manages email verification, doubling state and risking mismatched flags. | Delete the custom verification columns and rely solely on Supabase Auth‚Äôs `auth.users` tables or a single canonical status field. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/create_missing_tables.sql` | Creates alternative versions of `notifications`, `favorites`, `payment_transactions`, etc., conflicting with the primary schema and seeding duplicate system settings. | Remove this catch-all script; generate targeted migrations or use Supabase CLI diffs so tables aren‚Äôt forked into incompatible shapes. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/step4_enhanced_user_experience_fixed.sql` | Recreates `saved_searches`, `reviews`, `notifications`, `recently_viewed` with `gen_random_uuid()` and policies that clash with later definitions, plus seeds sample data tied to a hard-coded email. | Replace with a single canonical migration for UX tables or drop the step scripts entirely; keep sample data in fixtures, not migrations. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/step4_enhanced_user_experience_SAFE.sql` | ‚ÄúSafe‚Äù variant repeats the same tables/policies with conditional checks, so whichever script runs last wins‚Äîleading to inconsistent defaults and policy duplication. | Delete duplicate SAFE/FIXED scripts and maintain one migration history per feature; rely on Supabase migration tooling for idempotency. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/step4_enhanced_user_experience_ULTRA_SAFE.sql` | Third copy of the UX schema that still rewrites policies and defaults‚Äîonly now it silently no-ops when state drifts, giving a false sense that migrations succeeded. | Remove the ULTRA script and fold UX tables into a single, tested migration with proper Supabase CLI history. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/step5_advanced_search_simplified.sql` | Adds `search_analytics`/`popular_searches` tables plus city seed data outside transactions, but leaves RLS open to everyone and assumes geospatial columns without PostGIS guards. | Rebuild search analytics inside the core migration set, lock RLS to staff jobs, and wrap seed data in migrations or fixtures with readiness checks. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20250813000002_analytics_functions.sql` | SECURITY DEFINER functions update `apartment_analytics`/`analytics_events` but grant `authenticated` execute, so any user can fire cleanup jobs or modify metrics; depends on tables many envs never created. | Scope execution to service roles, check table existence, or replace with controlled RPCs executed by the backend. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20250813000003_performance_functions.sql` | Grants every authenticated user the ability to ANALYZE tables, create indexes, and run PostGIS queries via helper functions, risking DDL attempts and leaking schema stats. | Drop the grant to public clients and expose performance maintenance only through backend-run jobs with principle-of-least-privilege roles. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20250813_analytics_functions.sql` | Older duplicate of the analytics function set‚Äîrunning both files redefines the same helpers twice and can diverge grants/logging behaviour. | Delete the legacy copy and keep one canonical analytics function migration. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20250813_performance_functions.sql` | Another duplicate of the performance helper package, re-creating the same SECURITY DEFINER functions with wide grants. | Remove duplicate file and centralise performance helpers with locked-down privileges. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20250813140000_push_notifications.sql` | Creates `push_subscriptions` with permissive policies, logs via nonexistent `system_logs`, and ships SECURITY DEFINER `send_push_notification` that any authenticated user can run. | Drop the migration until the logging table and service wrapper exist; wire notifications through backend jobs with scoped roles instead of exposing direct SQL functions. |
| `supabase/migrations/backup/20250813_initial_schema.sql` | Early full-schema script that reintroduces `password_hash`, PostGIS `location`, and simplistic RLS; rerunning will flatten the live database back to 2024-era tables. | Archive the legacy schema outside migrations and rely on the maintained upgrade path instead of shipping reset scripts. |
| `js/backend/config/supabase.js` | Boots every backend client with the service-role key and even reuses it as the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù client when the anon key is missing, so any code that imports `supabasePublic` can escalate to admin privileges; it also `process.exit(1)`s when env vars are absent, crashing tests instead of failing fast. | Split admin vs. anon clients with distinct credentials, enforce required envs at startup without exiting mid-request, and audit consumers to ensure only least-privileged access. |
| `js/backend/services/emailService.js` | Constructor kicks off an async Gmail transporter but never waits for it, so the first emails race a null transporter; it also logs whether OAuth/app passwords are present (leaking secrets) and exposes fallback Gmail creds baked into the repo. | Refactor to an async `init()` that callers await, drop secret logging, and require env-supplied accounts rather than defaulting to `sichrplace@gmail.com`. |
| `js/backend/services/GdprService.js` | File combines a `FeedbackService` and huge GDPR helper that assumes dozens of tables/columns (`consented`, `withdrawal_timestamp`, etc.) exist; there‚Äôs no auth, pagination, or throttling, and stats queries will throw when structure doesn‚Äôt match. | Split feedback vs. GDPR concerns, guard every query behind schema/permission checks, and trim stats/helpers to match actual tables before shipping. |
| `js/backend/services/PaymentService.js` | Stripe client falls back to `'sk_test_placeholder'`, uses `userId` as `customer_email`, and never validates webhook signatures, so production payments either fail or accept spoofed events. | Require real Stripe keys, look up the customer email properly, and verify webhooks with Stripe‚Äôs signing secret before acknowledging requests. |
| `js/backend/services/RedisCacheService.js` | Tries to connect to `localhost:6379` on startup (Netlify/AWS lambdas won‚Äôt have Redis), logs every cache miss with full keys, and many callers assume `setWithExpiry` stores raw strings even though it wraps values in JSON. | Make Redis optional with feature flags, avoid noisy key logging, document the stored shape, and switch to a managed/remote cache before enabling in serverless. |
| `utils/secretManager.js` | Uses deprecated `createCipher`/`createDecipher` APIs without the generated IV, so ‚Äúencrypted‚Äù blobs can‚Äôt be decrypted reliably and fail AES-GCM authenticity checks; also falls back to a random in-memory master key each boot, breaking decryptions across instances. | Replace with `createCipheriv`/`createDecipheriv` using the stored IV, persist/require a stable 32-byte master key in env, and surface initialization failures instead of logging a warning. |
| `utils/securityMiddleware.js` | Calls `SecretManager.createSecurityHeaders()` as if it were static even though the module exports an instance; this throws before any handler runs, and the token ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù just base64 decodes without verifying signatures. | Import the default instance (e.g., `import secretManager from './secretManager.js'`) and call `secretManager.createSecurityHeaders()`, then plug in real JWT verification with signature checks. |
| `utils/rateLimiter.js` | In-memory store resets on every Netlify invocation, so attackers bypass rate limits by hitting a new lambda; also parses JWT payloads without signature checks, enabling spoofed `userId` fingerprints. | Back the limiter with Redis/Upstash (shared store), and only trust decoded JWT data after verifying it with the signing secret. |
| `netlify/functions/accessibility-inclusive-design.mjs` | Publicly exposes canned accessibility scores and accepts POST bodies without validation or auth, so reports can be forged. | Gate the route behind auth and back responses with real audits (or disable the endpoint until implemented). |
| `netlify/functions/add-property.mjs` | Boots Supabase with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` inside a Netlify function and falls back to a hard-coded JWT secret, leaking admin power to the edge. | Swap to the anon key with row-level policies, require a real `JWT_SECRET`, and move service-role writes to the backend API. |
| `netlify/functions/admin.mjs` | Admin APIs pull whole tables with the service-role key and run destructive deletes without transactions or pagination. | Restrict to secured backend admin service, add pagination, and wrap deletes in controlled workflows instead of running them in a function. |
| `netlify/functions/advanced-analytics.mjs` | Returns random analytics numbers while still initialising a service-role client and using `metrics.includes` on raw strings (substring collisions). | Remove the service-role dependency and either hook into the real analytics datastore or turn the endpoint off until data exists. |
| `netlify/functions/advanced-health-check.mjs` | Claims rate limiting/JWT checks without actually probing them and calls `process.memoryUsage()` (not exposed in Netlify Edge) under a service-role client. | Replace the mock payload with real dependency checks, handle missing Node APIs gracefully, and stop using the service key here. |
| `netlify/functions/advanced-logging.mjs` | POST actions fabricate log IDs without writing anywhere, so operators get false positives. | Wire the handler to our logging stack (or remove it) and block unauthenticated writes. |
| `netlify/functions/advanced-media-processing.mjs` | Upload/thumbnail routes just echo fake CDN URLs‚Äîfiles are never stored, and there‚Äôs no auth. | Connect to the actual media pipeline (Supabase storage/S3) and require authenticated callers before enabling. |
| `netlify/functions/advanced-search.mjs` | Targets tables like `apartment_photos`, `search_analytics`, `saved_searches`, and chains `.or()` repeatedly, so filters break and inserts can fail if tables don‚Äôt exist. | Audit the query builder, align field names with the live schema, throttle analytics logging, and guard every table before writing. |
| `netlify/functions/ai-machine-learning.mjs` | Presents fabricated AI metrics and integrations with no backing service or auth controls. | Either hook it up to real ML workloads or remove the endpoint to avoid misleading consumers. |
| `netlify/functions/ai-ml-services.mjs` | Same pattern: canned AI stats and fake recommendation payloads exposed to the public. | Implement genuine recommendation logic with proper security or retire the route. |
| `netlify/functions/analytics-stats.mjs` | Issues ten parallel service-role queries to tables (`bookings`, `user_activity`, `apartments.bookings`) that aren‚Äôt in the schema, causing 500s. | Reduce scope to existing tables, add existence checks, and move privileged analytics into the backend service. |
| `netlify/functions/apartments.mjs` | Service-role client returns raw apartment rows plus mapped fields, leaking landlord contact data and duplicating keys like `total_rent`. | Run via anon key with RLS, trim the selected columns, and build a clean response object without duplicates. |
| `netlify/functions/api-gateway.mjs` | ‚ÄúCreates‚Äù API keys by returning random strings and never persists them, so consumers believe gateways exist when they don‚Äôt. | Back the feature with a real key store or return 501 until the gateway is implemented. |
| `netlify/functions/auth-forgot-password.mjs` | Imports `../../js/backend/services/emailService.js` (won‚Äôt bundle on Netlify), writes via service key, and silently swallows email failures. | Move shared mailer code into the functions tree, call Supabase admin APIs from a secure backend, and surface delivery errors. |
| `netlify/functions/auth-login.mjs` | Runs authentication with the service-role key, depends on custom rate limiter/logger modules, and uses `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_here'` as a fallback. | Delegate login to Supabase Auth (or secure backend), require real secrets, and remove local service-role access. |
| `netlify/functions/auth-me.mjs` | Uses the service key to read `landlord_profiles`/`applicant_profiles`; if they‚Äôre missing, the call 500s, and the response duplicates fields. | Switch to anon key, tolerate absent profile tables, and normalise the payload before returning. |
| `netlify/functions/auth-register.mjs` | Falls back to the anon key yet inserts directly into `users`, hashes passwords into the legacy `password` column, and imports backend email code. | Use Supabase Auth `signUp`, keep service-role logic on the backend, and expose a shared mail utility within the functions bundle. |
| `netlify/functions/auth-resend-verification.mjs` | Returns the raw verification token/URL in the response and stores it unhashed while using the service key. | Hash tokens, send them via email only, respond with a generic success, and stop using the service-role key client-side. |
| `netlify/functions/auth-reset-password.mjs` | Issues a fresh JWT after password change using the service key and reuses stale user data for `mapUserToFrontend`. | Let Supabase auth handle resets, re-fetch the user after update, and avoid minting tokens inside the function. |
| `netlify/functions/auth-verify-reset-token.mjs` | Reveals whether a reset token is valid/expired, enabling brute-force probing, and again depends on the service key. | Respond with a generic success/failure, add throttling, and gate checks behind anon access with RLS. |
| `netlify/functions/auth-verify.mjs` | Inserts into `activity_logs` (may not exist) and uses external `hashToken` helper outside the bundle; service key exposed. | Inline the hash helper, guard optional tables, and move verification logic to a secure backend path. |
| `netlify/functions/backup-recovery.mjs` | Boots a service-role client but only serves static backup stats, giving a false sense of coverage. | Replace with a real backup orchestration hook or return 501 until implemented‚Äîno service key needed. |
| `netlify/functions/blockchain-integration.mjs` | Accepts POSTs that pretend to mint NFTs/process crypto without validation or chain access. | Remove or protect the route until an actual blockchain integration exists, and validate inputs rigorously. |
| `netlify/functions/booking-requests.mjs` | Service-role inserts into `booking_requests` (table absent), skips collision checks, and exposes landlord responses without filtering. | Implement the feature in the backend API with RLS, validate date overlaps, and restrict fields returned to the requester. |
| `netlify/functions/business-intelligence-analytics.mjs` | Exposes fabricated KPI data to anyone hitting the endpoint. | Back it with the real BI warehouse or disable the function to prevent misinformation. |
| `netlify/functions/cache-management.mjs` | Stores data in a per-invocation `Map`, so cache entries vanish between calls and unauthenticated users can flush everything. | Use a shared cache backend (Redis/Upstash), require auth, and drop the in-memory map. |
| `netlify/functions/cache-optimization.mjs` | Returns static cache metrics and success responses for operations that don‚Äôt run. | Hook into the real cache subsystem or unpublish the endpoint. |
| `netlify/functions/chats.mjs` | Service-role client bypasses RLS and exposes full chat transcripts; import path `../utils/` breaks bundling. | Rework chats to go through authenticated APIs with anon key + policies and keep utility modules within the functions directory. |
| `netlify/functions/compliance-reporting.mjs` | Reports compliance certificates and audits that don‚Äôt exist, risking legal misrepresentation. | Remove until compliance data is sourced for real or lock it behind admin auth with verified inputs. |
| `netlify/functions/configuration-management.mjs` | Publishes config summaries publicly and pretends to update settings without persisting them. | Require admin auth, persist changes in a config store, or disable the placeholder endpoint. |
| `netlify/functions/consent-management.mjs` | Uses the service-role key for consent CRUD, refers to helpers like `updateUserPreferencesFromConsent` that aren‚Äôt defined, and leaks full audit trails without guardrails. | Move consent workflows to a secured backend service, rely on anon key + RLS, and implement the missing helpers before re-enabling. |
| `netlify/functions/content-moderation.mjs` | Admin-only tooling exposed publicly; runs destructive moderation actions with the service-role key and assumes numerous tables/columns that may not exist. | Lock this behind authenticated admin APIs, validate table availability, and drop the service-role client from the function bundle. |
| `netlify/functions/conversations.mjs` | Conversation feed uses service-role access, unsupported Supabase subqueries for unread counts, and returns entire message history to any bearer of a JWT. | Rebuild on top of policies-safe anon access, split unread-count queries, and scope responses to the requesting user. |
| `netlify/functions/csrf-token.mjs` | Generates tokens but never stores or validates them server-side, yet still bootstraps Supabase with service-role credentials. | Remove the Supabase client, persist CSRF secrets server-side, or delegate CSRF to the backend instead of a public function. |
| `netlify/functions/data-migration-utilities.mjs` | Returns fabricated migration metadata while exposing a service-role client that could be expanded into destructive operations. | Disable until real migration orchestration exists or proxy through a secured admin backend with audited actions. |
| `netlify/functions/database-administration.mjs` | Presents fake DB stats and offers an `execute_query` path that could run arbitrary SQL with the service-role key. | Delete or fully secure the endpoint, and keep privileged database automation inside the backend with strict allow-lists. |
| `netlify/functions/deployment-management.mjs` | Reports deployment success/rollback statuses without touching real systems, encouraging false confidence. | Replace the canned responses with actual CI/CD hooks or retire the endpoint until integrations are implemented. |
| `netlify/functions/development-debugging-tools.mjs` | Mimics dev tooling (tests/builds/logs) but never performs them, inviting teams to trust nonexistent automation. | Remove the placeholder or wire it to real pipelines; in either case require authentication before exposing debug data. |
| `netlify/functions/email-management.mjs` | Service-role client plus `nodemailer.createTransporter` typo and expectations for tables (`email_templates`, `emails`) that aren‚Äôt provisioned. | Fix the transporter call, verify schema before use, and relocate privileged email workflows to the backend with service accounts. |
| `netlify/functions/email-notifications.mjs` | Sends notifications through Nodemailer without auth, exposing service-role data and fabricating delivery state. | Require authenticated callers, guard Supabase writes with anon key + policies, and connect to a real mail queue before advertising the endpoint. |
| `netlify/functions/email-service.mjs` | Same transporter typo and service-role exposure; returns ‚Äúsent‚Äù responses even when email infrastructure is absent. | Centralize email sending inside the backend, correct the transporter creation, and surface failure states instead of unconditional success. |
| `netlify/functions/enterprise-platform-overview.mjs` | Serves static enterprise ‚Äúmetrics‚Äù that aren‚Äôt backed by data, misleading stakeholders. | Replace with real observability wiring or remove the function to avoid misinformation. |
| `netlify/functions/enterprise-solutions.mjs` | Tenant/SSO provisioning endpoints accept POSTs without authentication and only return mocked payloads. | Gate behind admin auth, implement actual tenant/SSO provisioning, or return 501 until the feature exists. |
| `netlify/functions/error-tracking.mjs` | Logs browser errors with the service-role key, storing whatever PII clients send and duplicating the data in console logs. | Switch to anon key with row-level policies, sanitize payloads, and consider forwarding to a dedicated logging service instead. |
| `netlify/functions/external-api-integrations.mjs` | Exposes a faux integrations dashboard with canned metrics and mock POST operations. | Remove or back the endpoint with real integration checks before presenting it to clients. |
| `netlify/functions/favorites.mjs` | Uses the service-role key for favorites CRUD, exposing every renter‚Äôs favorites to anyone with a token and mapping helpers that may live outside the bundle. | Reimplement with anon key + RLS, keep mapping utilities within the function tree, and harden error handling before production use. |
| `netlify/functions/file-upload.mjs` | Accepts base64 blobs, writes to Supabase storage without size throttling, and trusts JWTs without CSRF or content scanning. | Offload uploads to signed URLs with size/type enforcement, add malware scanning, and move heavy processing to a backend service or worker. |
| `netlify/functions/financial-management.mjs` | Presents static financial KPIs but still initialises the service-role client, suggesting nonexistent real-time finance automation. | Either integrate with the finance data warehouse or disable the function to prevent misleading consumers. |
| `netlify/functions/gamification-rewards.mjs` | Publicly exposes fabricated gamification stats and POST actions that don‚Äôt persist data. | Hide behind auth and connect to a real rewards service or remove the placeholder route. |
| `netlify/functions/gdpr-compliance.mjs` | Executes every export/anonymise action with the service-role key and logs full request history, so a stolen token unlocks every table of personal data. | Swap to the anon key with tight RLS, trim exports to the minimum necessary fields, and gate high-risk actions behind secondary verification queues. |
| `netlify/functions/gdpr-tracking.mjs` | Drives 14 GDPR endpoints with the service-role key, falls back to `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_here'`, and lets unauthenticated callers run privacy audits or export site-wide logs while injecting arbitrary metadata into compliance tables. | Move the workflows to a verified Supabase session (or background job), drop the hard-coded JWT secret, and lock privileged reporting behind moderated queues with bounded payloads. |
| `netlify/functions/geolocation-analytics.mjs` | Claims deep mapping analytics but only returns canned numbers and random coordinates through open CORS, so product stakeholders get fake telemetry. | Remove the route until it fronts a real geolocation provider protected by auth and quota controls. |
| `netlify/functions/health.mjs` | Public health check mounts the service-role key to count users/apartments and dumps process metrics, leaking internals and bypassing RLS for anyone on the internet. | Serve a minimal ping backed by a low-privilege view or require admin auth before running Supabase diagnostics. |
| `netlify/functions/hello.mjs` | Bare demo endpoint with permissive CORS that just returns a timestamp, expanding the attack surface without delivering value. | Retire the function or fold the check into an authenticated status page. |
| `netlify/functions/insurance-integration.mjs` | Fabricates insurer partnerships, quotes, and claim flows with random data‚Äîno persistence or authentication‚Äîwhich misrepresents coverage status. | Hide it behind auth and wire it to a real insurance API (or delete the placeholder to avoid misleading customers). |
| `netlify/functions/internationalization-localization.mjs` | Emits fictional translation coverage stats and auto-success POST actions while exposing them publicly. | Replace with genuine localization tooling and session checks, or remove until the workflow exists. |
| `netlify/functions/iot-device-management.mjs` | Pretends to manage 835 IoT devices but simply echoes random responses for register/send-command on an open endpoint. | Decommission the stub or reimplement against actual device infrastructure with authentication and rate limits. |
| `netlify/functions/legal-compliance.mjs` | Publishes imaginary DocuSign stats and lets anyone "generate" contracts or background checks without persistence or auth, misleading stakeholders. | Pull it offline until real legal tooling exists, then restore behind verified staff credentials with durable storage. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-distance.mjs` | Acts as an unauthenticated proxy to Google Directions/Distance Matrix using the shared API key, so outsiders can burn quota or incur charges. | Remove the endpoint or wrap it with auth, request throttling, and a dedicated proxy key with strict usage limits. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-geocode.mjs` | Same open proxy problem for Geocoding, exposing the paid key to arbitrary callers and returning raw Google results. | Replace with client-side signed URL flow or gated backend service that enforces auth and rate limits. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-nearby-places.mjs` | Publicly streams Places results using the production key and mixes up `minRating` with `minprice`, so responses are both abusable and inaccurate. | Lock it down, validate parameters properly, and move to a server-protected API key or cached dataset. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-place-types.mjs` | Pretends to need the Maps key but just returns a hardcoded type list; still open to the world with needless key requirement noise. | Fold the static metadata into docs or static assets instead of a function, and drop the key dependency. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-reverse-geocode.mjs` | Opens reverse-geocoding on the shared key to anyone, enabling free quota drain and location harvesting. | Gate the handler behind auth/throttling or migrate to signed client requests. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-search-by-location.mjs` | Runs full Supabase searches with the service-role key, then calls Google Places without auth controls, and even references `mapArrayToFrontend`/`mapApartmentToFrontend` without importing them. | Rebuild around RLS-safe anon access, add the missing imports (or remove the call), and restrict Google requests with session-aware limits. |
| `netlify/functions/media-processing-cdn.mjs` | Publishes canned CDN/AV stats and auto-success POST actions on an open endpoint, so leadership sees fake diligence while attackers enumerate imaginary URLs. | Scrap the stub or wire it to real storage workflows with authentication, malware scanning, and per-tenant quotas. |
| `netlify/functions/messages.mjs` | Exposes 14 messaging verbs via the service-role client while accepting JWTs signed with the default `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_here'`, letting any leaked token dump conversations, attachments, and reactions. | Swap to Supabase sessions + RLS, remove the fallback secret, and isolate attachment uploads behind signed URLs with size/type validation. |
| `netlify/functions/mobile-api-services.mjs` | Returns fabricated mobile analytics and happily ‚Äúregisters‚Äù devices on POST without touching push providers or auth. | Remove the fa√ßade or implement genuine push registration with authenticated mobile tokens and telemetry sources. |
| `netlify/functions/monitoring-dashboard.mjs` | Reads `users` with the service-role key yet reports made-up uptime/security numbers to anyone on the internet, leaking internal topology. | Lock the dashboard behind admin auth, use low-privilege views, and back metrics with real monitoring data. |
| `netlify/functions/notifications.mjs` | Lets anonymous callers POST `createNotification` using the service-role key, so attackers can spam arbitrary payloads into every inbox. | Require authenticated internal callers (or queue) for writes, drop the service-role key, and enforce preference/rate limits. |
| `netlify/functions/paypal-enterprise.mjs` | 1.4k-line ‚Äúbulletproof‚Äù gateway runs on the service-role key, imports backend-only security utilities, and exposes `action=config` that hands out the live PayPal client ID, fee tables, and environment flags to the public; every payment/capture/refund path trusts bearer JWTs and writes rich payment metadata (landlord IDs, booking data) straight into Supabase from the edge. | Rehome the PayPal integration inside a backend service with least-privilege Supabase access, hide config behind server-to-server auth, gate actions with signed Supabase sessions + role checks, and keep the security helpers outside the Netlify bundle. |
| `netlify/functions/paypal-integration.mjs` | 1.1k-line PayPal bridge runs on the service-role key, falls back to `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_here'`, exposes `action=get_config` that hands out the live client ID/env, persists raw PayPal payloads (payer data, custom fields) into Supabase, and the webhook handler explicitly skips signature verification. | Move PayPal flows to a hardened backend using anon key + RLS, require real session auth, remove the public config endpoint, store only minimal payment metadata, and implement proper PayPal webhook validation before re-enabling. |
| `netlify/functions/paypal-payments.mjs` | Tiny edge wrapper exposes `GET /config` with the real PayPal client ID and proxies order create/capture using shared credentials; there‚Äôs no persistence, no rate limiting, and the webhook handler just logs without signature checks. | Drop the public function and centralize PayPal order handling in a backend service that stores state, hides credentials, enforces auth/rate limits, and validates webhooks before processing. |
| `netlify/functions/performance-optimization.mjs` | Public endpoint emits hardcoded ‚Äú95% overall score‚Äù dashboards plus fake bottlenecks/optimizations with zero telemetry, so stakeholders get fictional performance data while attackers learn internal assumptions. | Take it offline or rebuild behind authenticated ops tooling that sources real monitoring metrics and records provenance for every recommendation. |
| `netlify/functions/performance-overview.mjs` | Public GET leans on the service-role client to peek at `users`, optionally calls Google Maps with the shared key, then fills the payload with random CPU/error/cache stats‚Äîanyone online gets privileged data plus noisy third-party usage. | Retire the endpoint or move it behind authenticated ops tooling that queries low-priv Supabase views, rate-limits external health checks via a proxy key, and publishes only telemetry sourced from real monitoring. |
| `netlify/functions/privacy-controls.mjs` | Exposes the entire GDPR console over service-role credentials; a caller can pass any `user_id` to dump consent logs, upsert privacy settings, and log processing events with zero session ownership checks. | Replatform privacy workflows onto a hardened backend using verified Supabase sessions with RLS, validate that the requester owns the record, and queue high-risk changes for reviewed processing before touching consent tables. |
| `netlify/functions/realtime-chat.mjs` | Even with JWT auth, every conversation/message query runs through the service-role key, so a leaked token can enumerate all chats, participant profiles, and mark messages read across tenants. | Switch chat storage to Supabase policies or backend RPCs scoped by membership, drop the service-role client, and trim responses to only the requesting user‚Äôs permitted fields. |
| `netlify/functions/realtime-communication.mjs` | Stub endpoint fabricates WebSocket stats and acknowledges broadcast/subscribe POSTs without touching real infrastructure, misleading operators while expanding unauthenticated surface area. | Return 501 or remove it until realtime plumbing exists; when revived, require authenticated operators, persist actions, and stream metrics from the live transport layer. |
| `netlify/functions/recently-viewed.mjs` | Service-role history API returns mapped apartments with landlord emails/phones and lets any bearer token rewrite browsing history, while external mappers risk breaking Netlify bundling. | Rebuild the feature on Supabase sessions with RLS, limit landlord fields in the projection, embed the mapping helpers locally, and enforce per-user ownership on read/write/delete calls. |
| `netlify/functions/regulatory-compliance.mjs` | Publicly reports ‚Äúfully compliant‚Äù GDPR/CCPA status and processes privacy requests by minting fake IDs‚Äîno authentication, persistence, or audit trail backs the claims. | Disable the stub or relaunch it as authenticated compliance tooling that records requests durably, integrates with real auditors, and exposes read-only dashboards sourced from verified data. |
| `netlify/functions/revenue-analytics.mjs` | Aggregates live bookings/users with the service-role key, then pads gaps with `generateSimulated*` helpers so unauthenticated callers see authoritative-looking but fictional revenue dashboards. | Move analytics behind staff-only services using curated warehouse views (or retire the endpoint) and drop the simulation layer before exposing financial telemetry. |
| `netlify/functions/reviews.mjs` | Service-role reviews API still references `mapReviewToFrontend`, uses inconsistent column names (`requester_id`) after the schema change, and trusts global JWT secrets. | Switch to Supabase sessions, align filters with current schema, and keep mapping utilities bundled per function. |
| `netlify/functions/gdpr-compliance.mjs` | Attempts full GDPR workflows with the service-role key, assuming dozens of tables and returning raw personal data without rate limiting. | Migrate GDPR operations to a hardened backend job, enforce strict auth/throttling, and ensure required tables exist before enabling. |
| `netlify/functions/gdpr-tracking.mjs` | 1.6k-line mega handler using the service-role key; exposes every GDPR log/action to the public, runs risky deletes/exports without verifying table presence, and stores JWT fallback `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_here'`. | Move GDPR tracking to authenticated backend workflows with scoped anon access, split endpoints per concern, and require hardened secrets + schema guards before re-enabling. |
| `netlify/functions/geolocation-analytics.mjs` | Provides ‚Äúanalytics‚Äù output that‚Äôs entirely mocked yet implies real-time insights. | Disable or power it with actual geo analytics; no Supabase client is needed for placeholder content. |
| `netlify/functions/health.mjs` | Performs health checks using the service-role key to count tables, leaking system metrics and potentially failing if tables are absent. | Switch to anon-key safe probes, trim sensitive stats from the public response, and guard counts behind admin authentication. |
| `netlify/functions/hello.mjs` | Public demo endpoint with CORS `*` and no auth that advertises production readiness despite providing no diagnostics or guardrails. | Retire the hello endpoint or gate it behind admin tooling to avoid exposing unnecessary surface area. |
| `netlify/functions/insurance-integration.mjs` | Mimics insurance quotes/claims with randomised data and no validation or auth. | Implement real insurer integrations behind secured backend routes, or respond with 501 until the feature is built. |
| `netlify/functions/internationalization-localization.mjs` | Serves canned translation metrics and processes POST actions without hitting any translation service or requiring auth. | Replace with a real i18n pipeline (or disable) and ensure only authorised staff can mutate locale data. |
| `netlify/functions/iot-device-management.mjs` | Public endpoint invents IoT telemetry and accepts device registrations that go nowhere, yet implies operational control. | Remove the placeholder or back it with actual device management guarded by authentication. |
| `netlify/functions/legal-compliance.mjs` | Generates fake contracts/background checks using random IDs while promising DocuSign integration. | Gate behind legal/admin auth and wire the flows to real signature/verification providers before exposing it. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-distance.mjs` | Calls Google Maps Directions/Distance APIs directly, returning full route details to any caller and burning API quota without auth throttling. | Restrict access to authenticated clients, proxy via backend with rate limits, and cache/prevent leaking detailed itineraries. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-geocode.mjs` | Exposes raw geocoding for anyone, risking key abuse and returning full component breakdown with no access control. | Move geocoding behind backend auth, add per-user quotas, and consider masking sensitive address data. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-nearby-places.mjs` | Treats `minRating` as Google‚Äôs price filter, leaks detailed place data publicly, and offers no throttling. | Fix the rating filter, enforce auth/quotas, and cache results instead of live proxying Google for every request. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-place-types.mjs` | Static metadata endpoint still insists on a Google key and adds no functionality beyond hardcoded JSON. | Drop the API key dependency, move the metadata into the frontend bundle, or delete the redundant function. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-reverse-geocode.mjs` | Same unauthenticated Google proxying, disclosing precise addresses for any coordinates. | Require authenticated usage, add rate limiting, and mask sensitive component data before responding. |
| `netlify/functions/maps-search-by-location.mjs` | Uses the service-role key, references `mapArrayToFrontend`/`mapApartmentToFrontend` without imports (crashes), and double-proxies Google Places without auth. | Rebuild on anon key + RLS, import the missing mappers, and run Google lookups from a secured backend with quotas. |
| `netlify/functions/media-processing-cdn.mjs` | Publicly promises uploads, compression, and CDN delivery but only returns fabricated payloads with no security or persistence. | Disable the endpoint or back it with real storage/CDN processing behind authenticated admin workflows. |
| `netlify/functions/messages.mjs` | 1.5k lines of messaging logic running with the service-role key, fallback JWT secret, unsupported joins (parent message selects), and attachment handling that trusts client data. | Move messaging into the backend API with policies, remove the hard-coded secret, and split functionality into tested modules before exposing it. |
| `netlify/functions/mobile-api-services.mjs` | Returns fictional mobile metrics and accepts POST actions that do nothing, misleading consumers about mobile capabilities. | Replace with genuine mobile service hooks or remove the stub until the mobile stack exists. |
| `netlify/functions/monitoring-dashboard.mjs` | Uses the service-role key for ‚Äúhealth checks‚Äù while reporting fabricated uptime/alert data to any caller. | Drop the service-role client, gate monitoring behind ops auth, and serve real observability data (or remove the function). |
| `netlify/functions/notifications.mjs` | Service-role client + JWT secret gate GET/PUT, yet POST has zero auth, so anyone can insert notifications, trigger webpush (if VAPID keys set), or spam PII into `notifications`; helper exports let any imported module mint landlord/tenant alerts using the admin key. | Restrict creation to backend jobs or Supabase RPCs using anon key + RLS, enforce signed service-to-service auth, and move the helper exports into secured backend modules instead of bundling them with a public function. |
| `netlify/functions/reviews.mjs` | Public GET executes service-role joins that expose reviewer PII (`first_name`, `profile_picture`) and landlord metadata, while the update path filters on a non-existent `requester_id` column and writes to `comment` instead of `kommentar`, so edits silently fail. | Rebuild reviews behind Supabase policies or backend RPCs using the anon key, trim the selected fields to the minimum, and fix the column mappings before re-enabling moderation/update flows. |
| `netlify/functions/search.mjs` | Unauthenticated searches run with the service-role key, returning landlord emails/phones and ‚Äútotal rent‚Äù values derived from crude `price*0.7/1.2` heuristics; duplicate condition branches mean later filters overwrite earlier ones, making queries unpredictable. | Move search to an anon client backed by policy-safe views that redact landlord contact info, calculate totals server-side with real computed columns, and refactor the filter builder so each parameter maps to a single, deterministic Supabase condition. |
| `netlify/functions/security-monitoring.mjs` | Service-role client spins up to serve a fabricated 98% security score, and POST actions just mutate the in-memory response‚Äîno scans, logging, or auth‚Äîgiving leadership a false sense of protection while leaking that we even have a ‚ÄúSOC‚Äù endpoint. | Pull it offline or relaunch as a staff-only dashboard that reads from actual monitoring pipelines via low-priv credentials, persists actions, and drops the canned payload. |
| `netlify/functions/service-marketplace.mjs` | Anyone on the internet can call `register_vendor`/`book_service`/`rate_service` and receive authoritative-looking IDs even though no Supabase write occurs, so bogus marketplace activity can flood logs and mislead stakeholders. | Disable the stub or rebuild it as an authenticated marketplace service that performs real persistence, verification (KYC, insurance), and role checks before acknowledging requests. |
| `netlify/functions/simple-error-tracking.mjs` | Accepts arbitrary JSON without auth, echoing whatever attackers send straight into `console.error`; there‚Äôs no sampling, size enforcement, or trace correlation, so it becomes a PII exfil/DoS sink rather than telemetry. | Replace with an authenticated ingestion endpoint that validates payload shape, redacts secrets, batches to a trusted sink (Sentry/Logflare), and enforces rate limits per key. |
| `netlify/functions/simple-health.mjs` | Always returns 200 and enumerates which secrets are ‚Äúconfigured‚Äù vs ‚Äúmissing‚Äù, handing reconnaissance to attackers and encouraging teams to trust a health check that never probes downstream services. | Retire the handler or require authenticated ops callers, actually test dependencies (Supabase, external APIs), and stop surfacing secret status in the public payload. |
| `netlify/functions/social-networking.mjs` | Fabricated social metrics plus open POST actions (`create_post`, `follow_user`, etc.) let anyone mint fake engagement artifacts with timestamp IDs‚Äîno auth, persistence, or moderation‚Äîso dashboards and audit trails fill with fiction. | Remove the endpoint until connected to real community services with stored data, authenticated sessions, moderation workflows, and rate limits on social actions. |
| `netlify/functions/status-page.mjs` | Declares eight ‚Äúcritical services‚Äù yet never calls their endpoints‚Äîevery request just runs a service-role `users` probe, drops canned uptime/incident strings, and tells the world external monitors like ‚ÄúUptimeRobot‚Äù are green even if none exist. | Park the status UI behind authenticated ops tooling, source metrics from real monitors via read-only views, and banish the service-role client from public health feeds. |
| `netlify/functions/system-administration.mjs` | Mega-router gated by a JWT fallback `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_here'` that can dump system settings, kick off backups, export audit logs, and fire `setTimeout` jobs using the service-role key‚Äîassuming 20+ tables exist‚Äîso a forged token gets god mode forever. | Retire the Netlify function and rebuild admin ops as an audited backend service with scoped machine identities, explicit approval flows, and per-action rate limiting. |
| `netlify/functions/system-health-check.mjs` | ‚ÄúHealth‚Äù requests leak which env vars are missing, make unauthenticated Google Maps calls with the shared key, randomly mark functions healthy with `Math.random()`, and count users/apartments with the service-role client‚Äîperfect recon with fake confidence scores. | Lock health telemetry behind staff auth, replace direct Supabase access with least-privilege views, remove the random simulators, and publish only cached results from a real monitoring pipeline. |
| `netlify/functions/system-utilities.mjs` | Responds with static CPU/memory stats and lets anyone POST `system_restart`, `clear_cache`, or `optimize` to receive fake job IDs even though nothing happens‚Äîno auth, no logging, just a public fa√ßade of platform control. | Drop the stub or wire it to real orchestration guarded by authenticated operators, persisted audit trails, and defensive confirmation flows. |
| `netlify/functions/tenant-screening-employment.mjs` | Collects full employment dossiers (salary, employer contact, document URLs) under the anon key, writes them straight into Supabase, then approves applicants based on `Math.random()` after a 3‚Äì8‚ÄØs delay‚Äîno document validation and RLS must be off or everything fails silently. | Move employment checks into a locked-down backoffice desk that uses service accounts, encrypted storage, and deterministic verification workflows before touching Supabase. |
| `netlify/functions/tenant-screening-financial.mjs` | Router parses the final path segment but only three handlers exist; the advertised `upload-documents`/`verify-documents` endpoints explode while the surviving ones stash PII and fabricated affordability scores (made-up tax math, disposable income) using the anon key. | Fold financial screening into a hardened service that actually processes documents, enforces RLS, and validates income calculations with regulated providers before persisting anything. |
| `netlify/functions/tenant-screening-references.mjs` | Tenants can POST raw landlord contact histories that get stored with the anon key; ‚Äúverification‚Äù emails just log a URL, tokens are timestamp Math.random strings, and nothing stops token brute-force or landlord impersonation. | Run reference checks through a secured staff system with signed, expiring links delivered by a real mailer, encrypted storage, and Supabase policies that reject untrusted writes. |
| `netlify/functions/tenant-screening-schufa.mjs` | An anon-key ‚ÄúSCHUFA‚Äù flow stores full identity data (address, DOB, identityDocumentUrl) in Supabase, sleeps 2‚Äì5‚ÄØs, then `simulateSchufaAPI` invents a 650‚Äì900 score flagged valid for 90 days, so landlords see fabricated approvals while RLS must stay disabled for the inserts to succeed. | Pull the endpoint until a certified credit bureau integration runs from a service account with encrypted storage, audited consent, real API calls, and strict RLS; rip out the simulator and move processing into an asynchronous backoffice job. |
| `netlify/functions/test-apartments.mjs` | Public diagnostic still references `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY1`, prints key/URL previews, and exposes `apartments` joined with landlord emails/phones to whoever calls it‚Äîperfect for enumerating secrets and siphoning PII. | Delete the edge tester or replace it with an authenticated admin check that uses a least-privilege view, strips PII, and never echoes credential fragments. |
| `netlify/functions/test.mjs` | CORS `*` endpoint that parades `success:true`, the HTTP verb, and the requested path‚Äînothing more than a recon oracle for mapping live routes. | Remove it or bind it to authenticated diagnostics that redact path info, throttle callers, and return a generic heartbeat. |
| `netlify/functions/testing-utilities.mjs` | Hands out 100% pass dashboards and pretends to run suites/benchmarks for any POST body, minting fake run IDs without touching CI, storage, or auth‚Äîleadership sees green lights while no testing actually occurs. | Decommission the stub or front a real test pipeline that requires signed staff requests, persists results, and emits data sourced from the CI system. |
| `netlify/functions/third-party-integrations.mjs` | 760-line catch-all mixes anon-key Supabase writes with dozens of provider calls: it proxies Google Maps with the shared key, ‚Äúverifies‚Äù Stripe/PayPal webhooks by simply parsing JSON, pushes SendGrid/Twilio payloads straight to the vendors, and issues API keys/logs via tables that only work if RLS is off. | Break integrations into dedicated backend services that keep secrets server-side, verify provider signatures properly, enforce role checks/rate limits, and interact with Supabase through scoped service accounts instead of a public Netlify router. |
| `netlify/functions/user-activity-tracking.mjs` | Public `track` ingests arbitrary JSON, captures IP/device fingerprints, and writes straight into `user_activity`/`user_sessions` with the service-role key; analytics calls stream raw journeys back to anyone, and helpers like `new URL(page_url)` still crash on relative paths. | Move activity ingestion to authenticated beacons backed by anon-key + RLS, hash or discard sensitive client data, validate payloads with schema guards, and harden analytics endpoints behind staff auth with sanitized aggregates. |
| `netlify/functions/user-engagement-analytics.mjs` | 850-line analytics hub spins up the service-role client (plus fallback `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_here'`), shells out full `users`/`apartments`/`messages` tables into JSON, and runs serial Supabase loops for cohorts/heatmaps so a single call can leak PII and pin a lambda. | Rebuild analytics as curated warehouse views or RPCs exposed only to vetted staff, enforce real token/role checks, paginate heavy queries, and delete the Netlify fa√ßade until it serves audited, rate-limited data. |
| `netlify/functions/user-management.mjs` | Builds a service-role client guarded only by the fallback secret `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_here'`, lets callers pick any `user_id` for `get_user_profile`, returns full Supabase rows (email, phone, privacy settings), and ‚Äúupdates‚Äù passwords by comparing and storing plaintext‚Äîno hashing, no rate limits, and the shared mapper import may vanish at build time. | Replatform account management behind Supabase Auth or a backend API that enforces real sessions, hashes passwords server-side, scopes queries through RLS-safe views, and bundles the field-mapper code with the function (or drops it) before re-exposing the feature set. |
| `netlify/functions/user-profile.mjs` | Also runs on the service-role key + fallback secret; GET sprays PII (address, DOB, preferences) straight from `users`, PUT writes whatever JSON arrives without mapping back, and success hinges on `./utils/field-mapper.mjs` being accidentally bundled. | Replace the edge handler with a Supabase Auth RPC or backend route that uses anon key + RLS, limits the field list, validates payloads, removes the hard-coded secret, and embeds/maintains the mapper locally. |
| `netlify/functions/viewing-requests.mjs` | Tokens signed with the fallback secret can read every viewing request, including tenant phone/email and landlord addresses, because the service-role client bypasses RLS; updates key off the raw path segment, trusts `user.role` claims, and depends on external mapping helpers that often break Netlify bundles. | Move viewing management to a backend workflow using Supabase sessions, enforce ownership checks server-side, limit the response payload to non-PII fields, drop the default secret, and ship the mapping helpers within the bundle (or remove them). |
| `netlify/functions/vr-ar-integration.mjs` | Wide-open CORS endpoint fabricates VR/AR inventory, spins up fake tour/model IDs, and returns ‚Äúanalytics‚Äù on demand‚Äîno auth, no persistence, pure fiction that leaks assumed infrastructure. | Pull the stub until real VR/AR services exist, then reopen behind authenticated staff tooling backed by durable storage, provider SDKs, and audited job runners. |
| `netlify/functions/webhook-management.mjs` | Publishes hardcoded webhook inventories, claims Stripe/PayPal endpoints are live, and acknowledges create/update/delete/test actions without storing or signing anything‚Äîso anyone can forge ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù logs while ops believes deliveries are real. | Decommission the fa√ßade or rebuild as authenticated admin APIs that persist webhook configs, verify provider signatures, queue deliveries, and expose read-only stats derived from actual logs. |
| `netlify/functions/workflow-automation.mjs` | Another unauthenticated dashboard that pretends to run automations and schedules jobs, minting believable IDs even though nothing executes; callers can fabricate success metrics and hide real failures. | Retire the endpoint or gate it behind real orchestration tooling with auth, persistence, audited execution logs, and honest status reporting before exposing automation controls. |
| `js/backend/api/google-maps.js` | Every maps endpoint is public, proxying Google APIs with our server key and even returning the key via `/config`, while `/apartments/nearby` serves mock data as real inventory. | Lock the routes behind authenticated backend services, stop leaking API keys, and replace the placeholder apartment search with production logic or remove it. |
| `js/backend/api/upload-apartment.js` | Route skips auth yet relies on `req.user.id`, so uploads crash for real users, while multer writes files to the local filesystem with minimal validation. | Require authentication, load uploader middleware, persist images to durable storage, and harden field validation before enabling the endpoint. |
| `js/backend/api/viewing-confirmed.js` | Anyone can confirm a viewing request‚Äîthere‚Äôs no auth and it trusts whatever `requestId` arrives. | Enforce authenticated landlord access (or service role checks) before calling `ViewingRequestService.approve`. |
| `js/backend/api/viewing-didnt-work-out.js` | File is syntactically broken (`cons//`), duplicates route definitions, and returns success without emailing in most cases. | Fix the module structure, ensure it only exports one handler, and send mail via a reliable service with clear failure handling. |
| `js/backend/api/viewing-ready.js` | Yet another unauthenticated status mutator; anyone can mark requests as ‚Äúapproved‚Äù via this public route. | Gate the action behind landlord/admin authentication and validate ownership before updating status. |
