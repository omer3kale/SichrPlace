# Step 6 Business Intelligence & Analytics Solutions

This rollout guide turns the Step 6 overview into concrete tasks for engineering, data, and product teams so SichrPlace delivers actionable analytics and intelligence.

## 1. Data Collection & Instrumentation

**Backend Tasks**
- Expand existing Express middleware to capture page views, dwell time, click events, and funnel actions; persist events to `user_analytics` with partition keys for day/hour.
- Track property interactions (impressions, saves, inquiries) inside `services/propertyAnalyticsService.js`, writing to `property_analytics` with normalized payloads.
- Emit revenue and commission updates from payment flows by publishing structured events to a queue (BullMQ) before recording summarized rows in `platform_metrics`.
- Introduce feature flags for new trackers so operations can toggle instrumentation without redeploying.

**Database Tasks**
- Optimize analytics tables with composite indexes (e.g., `(date, metric_name)` on `platform_metrics`) and retention policies (30/90-day windows) to manage volume.
- Schedule nightly rollups via `supabase/functions` or cron-driven SQL scripts that aggregate raw events into KPI snapshots.

## 2. Analytics Dashboard Delivery

**Backend Tasks**
- Build `services/dashboardService.js` aggregations that output daily/weekly metrics, segment breakdowns, and trend deltas.
- Expose REST endpoints: `GET /api/analytics/dashboard`, `/users`, `/properties`, `/revenue`, each supporting query params (`range`, `segment`, `compareTo`).
- Gate admin-only APIs with role middleware and audit logging of dashboard access.

**Frontend Tasks**
- Create `frontend/admin-analytics.html` with reusable chart cards (Chart.js) and filter controls (date range, segment pickers).[^chartjs]
- Implement comparison mode UI: overlay previous period on charts, show % change badges, and highlight anomalies.
- Add export controls that call `GET /api/analytics/export?format=pdf|xlsx` and stream files to the browser.

## 3. BI Pipelines & Reporting

**Data Engineering Tasks**
- Stand up a lightweight ELT workflow (dbt or SQL scripts) orchestrated via Airflow or Supabase cron to build fact tables (`fact_searches`, `fact_revenue`) and dimensions (`dim_users`, `dim_properties`).[^dbt]
- Configure materialized views (e.g., `mv_daily_conversions`) refreshed hourly to feed the dashboard without expensive queries.
- Integrate an embedded BI tool (Metabase/Superset) for ad-hoc exploration; secure with SSO and row-level policies.

**Product/Operations Tasks**
- Define KPI dictionary documenting metric sources, formulas, owners, and alert thresholds; publish inside `docs/` for stakeholders.
- Create scheduled email digests summarizing key trends to leadership; leverage existing notification service.

## 4. Advanced Recommendation Engine

**Backend & Data Science Tasks**
- Extend Step 5 recommendations by training collaborative filtering models using `fact_searches` and favorites; deploy via a dedicated microservice container with REST endpoint `GET /api/recommendations/:userId`.
- Implement fallback heuristics (geo + price similarity) when the model lacks data, ensuring deterministic responses.
- Log recommendation impressions and click-throughs to evaluate precision/recall; surface metrics on the dashboard.

**Infrastructure Tasks**
- Automate model retraining nightly, storing artifacts in object storage with version tags; expose `/api/recommendations/model` for ops visibility.
- Monitor inference latency and errors with Application Performance Monitoring (APM) dashboards and alerts.

**Frontend Tasks**
- Add personalized sections (“Suggested Listings”, “Trending in Your Area”) on user dashboards using the new recommendations API.
- Provide explanations (reason tags) in the UI to build trust, falling back to most popular listings for anonymous users.

## 5. Quality, Telemetry & Governance

- Write Jest/Supertest suites covering analytics endpoints for authorization, filter handling, and pagination; add load tests (k6) to confirm dashboards stay performant under admin usage.
- Validate data pipelines with dbt tests or SQL assertions comparing fact counts to source tables.
- Instrument dashboards with client-side telemetry (e.g., viewing filters) to improve usability and track adoption.
- Document runbooks for pipeline failures, KPI anomalies, and model degradation; include escalation paths.

## Timeline & Ownership

| Window | Deliverable | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | Event instrumentation, analytics schemas, baseline ETL jobs | Backend + Data Engineering |
| Week 2 | Dashboard APIs, admin UI, export flows | Backend + Frontend |
| Week 3 | Recommendation service upgrade, telemetry dashboards | Data Science + Backend |
| Week 4 | QA hardening, governance docs, production rollout | QA + Ops |

## Exit Criteria

- All critical events (searches, bookings, revenue) flow into analytics tables with validated rollups.
- Admin dashboard renders KPIs, trends, and exports within target response times (<1s for primary views).
- Recommendation service delivers personalized results with tracked performance metrics.
- Ops team has documented runbooks, alerts, and data quality checks supporting ongoing maintenance.
