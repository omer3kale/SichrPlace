# Review System Integration Guide

## Quick Start

The review system is now fully implemented! Here's how to add it to your apartment detail pages:

## Step 1: Add CSS and JS to Your Apartment Page

In the `<head>` section of your apartment detail page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/reviews.css">
<script src="/js/reviews.js" defer></script>
```

## Step 2: Add the Review Section HTML

Copy the entire reviews section from `frontend/reviews-template.html` and paste it into your apartment detail page where you want reviews to appear (typically after apartment description).

## Step 3: Initialize the Review System

The template includes initialization code, but make sure to replace `{{APARTMENT_ID}}` with the actual apartment ID:

```javascript
// Example: Get apartment ID from URL parameter
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const apartmentId = urlParams.get('id');

if (apartmentId) {
  const reviewSystem = new ReviewSystem('/api');
  reviewSystem.init(apartmentId);
}
```

## Step 4: Update Homepage Stats (Optional)

Once reviews are integrated, update the sample apartment cards on index.html to show real review counts instead of placeholder numbers.
