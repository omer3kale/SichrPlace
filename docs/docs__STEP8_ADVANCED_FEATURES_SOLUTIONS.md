# Step 8 Advanced Features & Integrations Solutions

This implementation guide operationalizes Step 8 by outlining tangible tasks for digital contracts and advanced financial management, ensuring SichrPlace delivers compliant end-to-end rental flows.

## 1. Digital Contract System (Step 8.1)

**Backend Tasks**
- Create `routes/contracts.js` with endpoints: `POST /api/contracts/draft`, `GET /api/contracts/:id`, `POST /api/contracts/:id/sign`, `POST /api/contracts/:id/void`.
- Build `services/contractService.js` to generate agreement templates, merge tenant/landlord data, and track status transitions (draft, pending-signature, executed, voided).
- Integrate e-signature provider (DocuSign or HelloSign) via server-side SDK; store envelope IDs and callback handlers for webhook events.[^esign]
- Implement legal compliance checks: confirm ID verification status, property availability, and region-specific clauses before finalizing contracts.
- Generate immutable PDFs via server-side renderer (PDFKit) and persist to secure object storage with signed URL access control.

**Database Tasks**
- Add tables: `contracts` (id, apartment_id, tenant_id, landlord_id, status, effective_date, storage_path, jurisdiction), `contract_events`, `contract_templates`.
- Store audit trail entries whenever a contract changes status; include user ID, timestamp, IP, and signature hash.
- Create migration scripts and update Supabase or ORM models accordingly.

**Frontend Tasks**
- Build contract management UI in `frontend/dashboard-contracts.html` showing draft/active/expired lists, status badges, and action buttons.
- Provide guided contract creation forms with inline validation, clause previews, and jurisdiction selection.
- Embed signature flow using provider’s client SDK or redirect with success/failure callbacks; render signed PDF for download and notify parties via email.

**Compliance & Security Tasks**
- Encrypt stored contract metadata at rest; restrict access by role (landlord, tenant, admin) with server-side authorization.
- Maintain version history for contract templates; allow legal team to upload new revisions via admin panel.
- Document legal disclaimers and acceptance steps inside `docs__STEP8_ADVANCED_FEATURES_SOLUTIONS.md` appendix for future audits.

## 2. Financial Management System (Step 8.2)

**Backend Tasks**
- Expand payment microservice with recurring billing, escrow handling, and multi-provider routing (Stripe ACH, bank transfer APIs) using provider SDKs.[^stripe]
- Build commission engine: `services/revenueService.js` calculates platform fees, referral bonuses, loyalty points, and posts entries to `transactions`.
- Implement automated rent collection by scheduling invoices and payment intent creation (node-cron) with retries and dunning flows.
- Add refund and dispute workflows: webhook handling, ledger adjustments, and notifications to stakeholders.

**Database Tasks**
- Extend schema with tables: `recurring_payments`, `escrow_accounts`, `commission_rules`, `loyalty_balances`, `referral_codes`.
- Normalize financial transactions into double-entry ledger (debits/credits) to support audits; include monthly closing procedures.
- Keep rate tables for tax/VAT rules per region and link to invoices.

**Frontend Tasks**
- Enhance `frontend/finance-dashboard.html` to display revenue summaries, upcoming payments, escrow balances, referral earnings, and loyalty tiers.
- Provide onboarding wizard for landlords to configure payout methods and commission settings.
- Expose tenant payment history with downloadable receipts (PDF) and upcoming invoice reminders.

**Operations & Compliance Tasks**
- Implement AML/KYC checks using vendor APIs before enabling payouts; store verification status in user profile.
- Generate monthly financial reports (CSV/PDF) covering gross revenue, platform commissions, and liabilities; schedule automated delivery to finance team.
- Ensure PCI compliance: tokenize payment details via provider, avoid storing sensitive card data locally, and run quarterly penetration tests.

## 3. Shared Infrastructure & Governance

- Version configuration in `.env.example`: add ENV vars for contract provider keys, escrow webhooks, loyalty toggles.
- Update CI/CD to run integration tests against contract sandbox and payment providers; mock networks in Jest/Supertest.
- Monitor financial processes with alerts on failed payouts, unsigned contracts nearing deadlines, and escrow anomalies.
- Document SOPs for contract disputes, failed signatures, and financial reconciliations; publish runbooks in `docs/` for support teams.

## Timeline & Ownership

| Window | Deliverable | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | Contract service endpoints, schema migrations, template management | Backend |
| Week 2 | E-signature integration, contract UI, PDF generation, compliance review | Backend + Frontend + Legal |
| Week 3 | Financial management services (recurring billing, commission engine) | Backend + Finance Ops |
| Week 4 | Frontend finance dashboards, reports, QA automation, rollout checklist | Frontend + QA + Ops |

## Exit Criteria

- Contracts can be drafted, signed, and stored securely with full audit trails and legal approval.
- Financial system handles recurring payments, escrow, commissions, referrals, and loyalty balances with accurate ledger entries.
- Dashboards surface contract statuses and financial KPIs; stakeholders receive scheduled reports.
- Compliance requirements (KYC, PCI, legal audit trails) are documented and enforced with monitoring and runbooks in place.
