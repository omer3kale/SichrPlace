# Step 9 Scalability & Performance Solutions

This playbook operationalizes Step 9 so SichrPlace scales reliably with monitored infrastructure, balanced traffic, and resilient integrations.

## 1. Infrastructure Optimization (Step 9.1)

**Backend & Infra Tasks**
- Profile database workloads; add read replicas for Supabase/Postgres, tune slow queries with EXPLAIN plans, and introduce connection pooling (pgBouncer) for consistent throughput.
- Implement Redis caching for frequent reads (popular listings, search facets); expose cache helpers in `backend/utils/cache.js` and standardize TTL per domain.
- Introduce CDN (Cloudflare/Akamai) for static assets: configure DNS, cache headers, and image optimization rules; ensure cache busting through build hashes.
- Deploy load balancer (NGINX/ALB) in front of Node.js backend; configure health checks, rolling deployments, and canary routing for new releases.
- Containerize services (Docker) with resource limits; orchestrate via Kubernetes or ECS with autoscaling based on CPU/RPS metrics.

**Database Tasks**
- Partition large analytics tables by date; create maintenance jobs for vacuum/analyze and index refreshes.
- Implement backup/restore automation (daily snapshots, point-in-time recovery) and verify quarterly restore drills.

## 2. Monitoring & Logging

**Observability Stack**
- Deploy Application Performance Monitoring (Datadog/New Relic) to capture transaction traces, error rates, and latency percentiles; instrument key endpoints with custom spans.
- Centralize logs using ELK or OpenSearch; define structured logging in backend (`logger.info('search.query', { filters, userId })`) and configure retention + alerting.
- Set up metrics dashboards (Grafana) covering API latency, queue depth, cache hit ratio, DB connections, and front-end Core Web Vitals.[^grafana]
- Integrate error tracking (Sentry) across backend/frontend; enable release tagging and automatic Slack/Teams notifications on regression thresholds.

**Alerting & SLOs**
- Define Service Level Objectives (e.g., 99.5% availability, p95 latency < 400ms); configure alerts when burn rate exceeds thresholds.
- Establish on-call rotation playbooks detailing escalation paths, runbooks, and post-incident reviews.

## 3. API & Integration Platform (Step 9.2)

**Third-Party Integrations**
- Google Maps: encapsulate geocoding and map tiles in `services/mapsService.js`; apply quota management and cache responses.
- Calendar integrations: implement OAuth flows for Google/Outlook; sync viewings via webhook handlers and background jobs.
- Social login: enable OAuth 2.0 providers with passport.js; unify account linking and recovery flows.
- Property syndication: build export jobs to partner APIs (XML/JSON feeds); monitor delivery with retries and logging.

**Security & Reliability**
- Rate limit integration endpoints, add circuit breakers, and fallback data when providers fail.
- Store provider credentials in secure secrets manager; rotate keys regularly.

## 4. QA, Load Testing & Automation

- Create k6/Gatling load tests simulating peak traffic (search, booking, messaging) with targets aligned to SLOs; run in CI and pre-release gates.[^k6]
- Implement chaos testing (Gremlin/Litmus) to validate failover: terminate pods, throttle DB, and observe recovery.
- Add automated health checks & synthetic monitors verifying critical user journeys (search, payment intent, contract signing) every 5 minutes.

## Timeline & Ownership

| Window | Deliverable | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | Database tuning, caching layer, CDN rollout | Backend + DevOps |
| Week 2 | Load balancer setup, container orchestration, autoscaling | DevOps |
| Week 3 | Observability stack, alerting policies, SLO definition | DevOps + Backend |
| Week 4 | Third-party integration hardening, load/chaos tests, runbooks | Backend + QA |

## Exit Criteria

- Infrastructure scales horizontally with load-balanced containers, cached content, and optimized database operations.
- Observability dashboards and alerts monitor performance, availability, and errors with defined SLOs and on-call procedures.
- Third-party integrations (Maps, Calendars, Social login, Syndication) operate with resilient retry, rate limiting, and credential management.
- Load and chaos tests validate system stability; synthetic monitoring confirms user journeys remain healthy under stress.
