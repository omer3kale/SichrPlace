## âœ… Email Verification Testing Plan

After running the SQL migration in Supabase, test these steps:

### 1. Register a New User
```bash
curl -X POST https://www.sichrplace.com/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testverify","email":"your-email@gmail.com","password":"Test123!","userType":"applicant","fullName":"Test User"}'
```

### 2. Check Your Email
- Look for verification email from SichrPlace
- Click the verification link
- Should redirect to `/verify-email.html?token=...`

### 3. Verification Should:
- âœ… Show success message
- âœ… Mark user as verified in database
- âœ… Provide login token for immediate access
- âœ… Redirect to dashboard

### 4. Test Edge Cases:
- Invalid/expired tokens
- Already verified accounts  
- Resend verification email

### 5. Database Verification:
Check in Supabase that user has:
- `verified = true`
- `verification_token_hash = null` (cleared after use)
- `verified_at` timestamp set

## ðŸ”§ Fixed Components:
- âœ… API endpoint paths (`/auth/verify` not `/api/auth/verify-email`)
- âœ… Token verification logic with proper JWT validation
- âœ… Database schema with verification columns
- âœ… Email service with correct verification URLs
- âœ… Frontend verification page with proper error handling
