# ❌ Marketplace Test Failures – October 13, 2025

## Summary
Running `npm test` shows:

```
Test Suites: 1 failed, 5 passed, 6 total
Tests:       6 failed, 43 passed, 49 total
```

All remaining failures come from `backend/tests/integration/marketplace.test.js`.

## Failing Tests & Root Cause

| Test | Expected | Actual | Root Cause |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/marketplace/listings` (x4 variants) | 200 OK | 404 Not Found | `js/backend/routes/marketplace.js` does **not** define any `router.get('/listings', …)` handler. Only POST routes (`/contact`, `/chat`, `/payment`, etc.) exist. |
| `POST /api/marketplace/listings` (unauthenticated) | 401 Unauthorized | 404 Not Found | There is no `router.post('/listings', …)` implementation; tests expect this to exist (both success + auth rejection flows). |
| `GET /api/marketplace/chats` (unauthenticated) | 401 Unauthorized | 404 Not Found | `router.get('/chats', …)` is missing; only `router.post('/chat', …)` is provided. |

Because the handlers do not exist, Supertest receives 404 responses instead of the expected status codes.

## Suggested Fix Options

1. **Implement Missing Marketplace Endpoints** (mirroring Option A in the fix plan)
   - Add handlers for:
     - `GET /api/marketplace/listings`
     - `POST /api/marketplace/listings`
     - `GET /api/marketplace/chats`
   - Use Supabase queries or temporary mock payloads to satisfy the tests.

2. **Adjust Tests** if the current backend contract deliberately omits these routes.
   - Update `marketplace.test.js` to target the existing API surface (e.g., `/contact`, `/chat`).

3. **Compatibility Wrapper**
   - Add a lightweight router that maps the expected paths to available logic or mock data while full implementations are built.

## Next Steps
- Decide whether to implement the endpoints (recommended) or realign the tests.
- Once code changes are applied, rerun:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm test -- tests/integration/marketplace.test.js
  ```
- Update documentation and Swagger specs if new endpoints are added.
