# Documentation Inventory – Solution Ideas

Grounding our cleanup plan in external guidance:

1. **Define audiences and structure content accordingly.** The Write the Docs beginner guide stresses distinguishing user and developer audiences, documenting installation/support/contribution paths, and avoiding unstructured FAQ dumps[^1]. Map our docs collection into user vs. maintainer tracks and drop FAQ-style fragments once richer pages exist.
2. **Lead with a clear project overview and README-style landing page.** Write the Docs recommends starting with an introductory page that states the problem, shows a minimal example, and links to code and issue tracker[^1]. Use this pattern when consolidating the docs index so newcomers land on a single authoritative entry point.
3. **Document contribution/support channels.** Contributors rely on explicit instructions for filing issues and contributing[^1]. Ensure the curated docs index links to issue tracker, Slack/Discord (if any), and contribution guide.
4. **Provide concise installation/getting-started flows with deeper links.** Keep quick-start steps brief, then link to advanced configuration pages[^1]. When merging overlapping setup guides, adopt this two-tier approach.
5. **State licensing and compliance expectations.** Users care about licensing, and the guide calls out including the project license upfront[^1]. Surface licensing/compliance references (GDPR, etc.) from the docs index.
