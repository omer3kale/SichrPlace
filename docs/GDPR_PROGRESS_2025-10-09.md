wk# GDPR Progress Report — 2025-10-09

_Status: Core GDPR suite locked at 100% coverage across config, middleware, routes, and services._

## Snapshot
- ✅ `js/backend/tests/routes-gdpr.test.js` now drives 100% statement/branch coverage for `routes/gdpr.js`, including every fallback branch the user flagged (lines 147, 160, 183, 371, 393).
- ✅ Auth middleware (`middleware/auth.js`) holds complete coverage after combining isolated unit tests with real JWT failure paths.
- ✅ Supabase configuration (`config/supabase.js`) and GDPR service layer (`services/GdprService.js`) both sit at 100% thanks to exhaustive unit suites and proxy verifications.
- ✅ Latest full Jest run (`npx jest --config js/backend/jest-fixed.config.js --coverage`) reports 129/129 tests green in 2.67s with a clean coverage dashboard.

## What’s Been Achieved Since 2025-10-08

| Area | Progress |
| --- | --- |
| **GDPR routes** (`routes/gdpr.js`) | Added consent withdrawal fallbacks (legacy ID, null returns, aggregated consent reconstruction) plus export payload assembly tests, closing all remaining uncovered branches. |
| **GDPR requests** | Tests now assert default description generation and legacy `_id` propagation for request creation, removing the final gaps at lines 147 and 160. |
| **Consent status / requests listings** | Added null-to-empty-array expectations to exercise `|| []` fallbacks (line 183). |
| **Withdraw consent response** | Verified multi-level nullish coalescing for consent identifiers (line 371) via targeted mocks. |
| **Consent status summary** | Confirmed array fallback handling (line 393) with explicit `null` returns from the service. |
| **Supabase + middleware suites** | Retested to ensure no regressions; both still deliver full coverage post-route changes. |

## Coverage Summary (Full Suite — 2025-10-09)
_Command: `npx jest --config js/backend/jest-fixed.config.js --coverage`_

| File | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `config/supabase.js` | 100% (100/100) | 100% (12/12) | 100% (8/8) | 100% (100/100) |
| `middleware/auth.js` | 100% (95/95) | 100% (28/28) | 100% (10/10) | 100% (95/95) |
| `routes/gdpr.js` | 100% (417/417) | 100% (68/68) | 100% (9/9) | 100% (417/417) |
| `services/GdprService.js` | 100% (580/580) | 100% (128/128) | 100% (17/17) | 100% (580/580) |
| **Aggregate** | **100% (1192/1192)** | **100% (236/236)** | **100% (44/44)** | **100% (1192/1192)** |

## Quality Gates Snapshot

- ✅ **Tests:** 4 suites / 129 test cases passing via `npx jest --config js/backend/jest-fixed.config.js --coverage`.
- ✅ **Coverage:** Statements, branches, functions, and lines all at 100% across targeted modules.
- ✅ **Logs:** No unexpected warnings or console noise during the run; execution time 2.67s on local Windows workstation.

## Remaining Enhancements

Although coverage targets are met, a few optional refinements remain valuable for long-term maintainability:

1. **Advanced GDPR admin endpoints**
   - Revisit archived admin routes/tests (`docs/GDPR_TEST_FAILURES.md`) now that base coverage is secured.
   - Implement or retire endpoints to align with documented expectations.

2. **Monitoring & Regression Guardrails**
   - Promote the coverage run into CI to guard against future regressions.
   - Capture the HTML report artefact for historical comparisons.

3. **Documentation**
   - Update `docs/docs__backend__tests__README.md` with the standard coverage command and maintenance tips.
   - Record the 100% milestone in the broader deployment readiness docs.

- `docs/GDPR_TEST_FAILURES.md` — status tracker for the advanced/admin backlog.
- `docs/GDPR_TEST_FIX_PLAN.md` — change log covering initial GDPR route repairs.
- `docs/TEST_SUITE_RATIONALIZATION.md` — context for the streamlined Jest suite.

With the critical modules at 100% coverage and all tests green, we can shift focus to the remaining admin feature backlog without risking regressions in the core GDPR compliance surface.
