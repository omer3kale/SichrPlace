# Step 11 IoT & Smart Home Integrations Solutions

This guide operationalizes Step 11 to bring smart property capabilities into SichrPlace with secure, scalable integrations.

## 1. IoT Device Integration Framework

**Backend Tasks**
- Establish `services/iotHubService.js` abstracting device vendor APIs (e.g., Tuya, Zigbee, HomeKit) with pluggable adapters; store credentials in secrets manager.
- Build `routes/iot/devices.js` for landlord onboarding: `POST /api/iot/devices/register`, `GET /api/iot/devices`, `DELETE /api/iot/devices/:id`.
- Implement webhook receivers for device telemetry and events; validate signatures to prevent spoofing.
- Support command dispatch (lock/unlock, thermostat set point) with queue-based execution and response tracking.

**Database Tasks**
- Create tables: `iot_devices` (id, property_id, vendor, capabilities, status), `iot_events` (device_id, payload, received_at), `iot_commands` (status, issued_at, ack_at).
- Store device metadata, firmware versions, and last known state for offline visualization.

## 2. Virtual Tours & Media Enhancements

- Integrate 360Â° photo/video providers (Matterport/CloudPano) via embed tokens; link assets to listings in `property_media` table.
- Build VR-ready viewer in `frontend/property-tour.html` with fallback for non-WebGL devices.
- Offer scheduling flows to request live virtual tours via video conferencing integrations (Zoom/Teams SDKs).

## 3. Smart Lock & Access Management

**Backend Tasks**
- Integrate smart lock APIs (August/Yale); generate time-bound access codes for tenants, cleaners, inspectors.
- Implement `POST /api/iot/access-codes` with parameters (device, valid_from, valid_to, recipient). Store codes hashed and enforce rotation.
- Log entry events and sync to notification system for landlord alerts.

**Frontend Tasks**
- Landlord dashboard view showing current access codes, status, and revoke actions.
- Tenant portal integration exposing upcoming viewings with access instructions and emergency contact.

## 4. Energy & Efficiency Tracking

- Collect consumption data (electricity, water) from IoT devices; aggregate daily totals and compute benchmarks per property type.
- Visualize trends in analytics dashboard: show energy score, potential savings, and recommended actions.
- Provide opt-in reports for tenants to encourage sustainability.

## 5. Security, Privacy & Compliance

- Enforce device authentication: rotate API keys, use OAuth where available, and restrict commands to verified landlords.
- Maintain encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256 for device credentials).
- Draft privacy notices detailing IoT data usage; ensure tenant consent before enabling monitoring features.
- Implement incident response: detect abnormal device activity, trigger alerts, and provide disable switch per property.

## Timeline & Ownership

| Window | Deliverable | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | IoT service architecture, device onboarding APIs, database schema | Backend |
| Week 2 | Smart lock integration, command execution pipeline, dashboard UI | Backend + Frontend |
| Week 3 | Virtual tour embedding, energy analytics, sustainability reports | Frontend + Data |
| Week 4 | Security hardening, privacy docs, QA automation, rollout training | Security + QA |

## Exit Criteria

- Properties can register supported IoT devices, issue commands, and monitor telemetry through the platform.
- Smart lock access codes are managed with audit trails and alerts, improving safety for viewings and move-ins.
- Virtual tours and energy analytics enhance tenant engagement with reliable performance across devices.
- Privacy, compliance, and incident response protocols are documented and enforced for all smart home features.
